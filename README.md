This program uses buffered input to read text from file fast. 
It contains functions for 
1) Reading input
2) Building special structure for parsing text on lines
3) Printing out text based on this special structure
4) Sorter for lines structure.
5) Some string functions to work with strings and lines

## Reading input:

Functions in InputOutput.h can read input using buffer to fast up it.

## Building lines:

Function in StringFuncs.h BuildLinesArr builds special array with lines in it to use for effective sorting

## Printing: 

Functions in InputOutput.h that are used for printing text based on lines array. Also contains functions for printing out standard text and lines.
