A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
A simple maiden
A menu hangs for order’s sake And teases appetite in vain.
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
A yard boy’s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
A hundred times is blessed, who’s faithful. Who’s got his wit to be quite calm,
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
A shepherd bast gay sandal’s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
A brave sledge-cart from field’s returning, It’s fluffy furrows upturning,
A mere hit from all I’d give.
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
A dwarf with tail; and there’s that Who’s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
A bee to fields, of tribute well,
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
A book at mornings here read...
A need for sleep.
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he’s killed...’
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
A lady’s love until to-day To speak her Russian isn’t trying,
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
A bowl
A passionate epistle’s writing.
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation’s lint, -
About Lensky’s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn’t talk at all,
About other’s restless passions, And other’s love will touch the heart, -
About what she’s now dreaming?
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
Across a glade, all under snow Around which all’s dark and sad.
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
Again promiscuosly he’s reading… Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
‘Agreed’ - You... dear guy!
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
Ah, he could love; they don’t now Have anything like real love
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
‘Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
‘Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?’ -All right, my dear, you command.-
Ah, don’t mind’ -My friend, by God to hail I dare —
‘Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, I’m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Onegin’ -Well done dealing.
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
‘Ah, my Lord!’,
Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry,
‘Ah, Eugene!’, - She is quickly running, Like shade she’s prompt, to exit’s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back it’s hard; In short a minute she’s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
Ah! I’ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.
‘Ah, father my! the profit’s worsened..’.
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyana’s heart was burnt!
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
Ah, many were by fate denied!
Ah, many friends were near then!
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
‘Ah, Tanya!
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
Alas! I must repeat again:
Alas! On furrows of lives
Alas, Tatyana’s daily fading: She’s paling, sinking and is mute,
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I’ve ruined much of own life.
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn’t be.
Alas, it’s easy to divine!
Ali that has gone like sound’s fizz, And dear Tanya’s youth all dwindles:
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
All’s blight, all’s white without shade.
All services of old time.
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end life’s novel reading,
All flows in a single gear...
- All they are yet feeling
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
All fashioned model of the creature Who’s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
All yet living
All’s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy Pustyakóv
All barking, dogs to her are running.
All they utter
All have the supper.
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
All that I don’t grasp.
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
All right, by hand unfair own
All’s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I don’t know why.
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
All’s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
All’s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
All that I gladlessly survived.
All poets, meanwhile I’ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: ‘It’s mine! Its mine’
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
Alone’s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
Alone you, to speak my mind, I’d take as friend of days my grievous,
Alone with his soul’s self Unsatisfied was by himself.
Alone to my nurse, who’s being My old friend from youth and forth.
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girl’s small feet and no heads.
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
Already for triumph he’s waiting,
Alter him
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
Among the friends the moon’s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poet’s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
Among admirers obedient I’ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journal’s clamour
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
And you, ‘Bordeaux’ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
‘And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
And me you have in view...
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
And stilly does she say at last:
And give you all that 1 could scribble
And then he dressed himself...
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
And what.
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
And what’s Onegin doing?
And what? -
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
And boring pictures’ row, done In style of La Fontaine’s sweet novels.
And by degrees to sleep he’s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
And what?
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!’
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,
And when a falling shining star
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
And when sometimes in front of her
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
And he inspired her at dawns!
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
And didn’t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
And by the salt of worlds backbiting
And with Onegin’s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she’s free.
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
And what?
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
And where everything’s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
And then at prince she was adjusting
And… he could not.
And no brow moved she rasher; She didn’t even lips her press.
And who, d’you think, from it is looking?
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful she’s shyly stepping
‘And whom?’ - She’s Larin’s. -
And how long?’ ‘Two will he fast...’
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesn’t move and doesn’t breathe;
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
And fair sex like down’s slight...
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
And let them God long live for us!
And can’t; she’s now deeply worrier!, She moans and she’d like to cry...
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
And by the people’s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
And often in the summer’s sphere, When clear is the sky at night
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
And what for is can now lurid?
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
And what?
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
And often at Taurida’s beaches She brought me in the have of night
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
‘And whom your lovely verse adored?’
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
And whispered her each one of them: ‘You look left side at those men…’
And unattentive smart lornette.
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once one’s feelings strikes.
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l don’t want;
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
And Tatyana’s nervous
And. told her:
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, he’s being in a whim.
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
And he invents by whim’s requests Caricatures of the guests.
And she, that young and lovely creature;
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden’s choice,
And all grandparents exclaim: ’But how years fly away!’
‘And I was gingebread you giving!’
‘And I your ears pulled by hands!’
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
And she has had
And exclamations at the board:
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...
And that... but afterwards you’ll know, Is not it true?
And she, as if she’s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
And great belief in world’s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
And nothing cooled his strong belief:
And now North, all clouds driving,
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine.
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
And what can give me fate of mine?’
And you forgive, my freedom later!
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again he’s dancing.
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
And what’s the reason?
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
And drifting of the country’s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
And. so cunny, she is gay. Already’s able to betray!
And in a day
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet she’s sighing once again
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
And gradually rises day.
And Olga’s yawning; round here She’s looking for her Lensky dear.
‘And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.’.
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soul’s rate
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
And old barin room this had;
And here is the banns room.
And with a bow
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novel’s crank.
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
And in the solitude severe Her passion’s heating yet much more,
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldn’t cry,
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
And so grew they old both.
And wondered: would he be alive?’
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
And then I thought: He’s now in;
And there… -
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that’s why at borne
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
And I’m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
And am I soon at thirties turn?
And is it true, it can’t return?
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
And where is her sister line?
And passed away of tears time?
And slowly through fields she’s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madman’s hearty mock.
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
And now jealouser’s triumphant!
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
And much the more it’s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
And I’ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
And proud language’s now lit For prose postal a bit.
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
And stands at stint
And quickly both they yet off
And I’m in family unknown...
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
Andryushka, quicker must you go!
Annette; And on the last one you read so:
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?
An Lane’s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
Apostate of wild enjoyments,
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but don’t we. confess.
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
Appolo’s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
Are silent.
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Onegin’s eyes make tire own,
Are drying valleys many-coloured;
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we can’t endure,
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
Arid, following Petrarka’s tracks, Could calm his heart’s the biggest trouble.
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
Arid thus we now part, forgive!
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
Around Tanya ladies crowd,
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..’
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
As legends say of old age (For that we’d praise in him the sage).
As pawn that’s worth of dear mate.
As at the reason of the parting Tatyana’s grumbling at the brook,
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, who’s lost in thought,
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...
As I to loose my freedom feared Which’s hateful to my own will.
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
As they are mean and simple features, You won’t see fine art in that.
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
As quick as can
As if by greenish down covered.
As sign of friendship’s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
As object of the judging noisy, In life you’d never have a wish:
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didn’t want
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizon’s foolish brightness’.
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
At first of them she didn’t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
At window she now sits.
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
At other kinds of lines.
‘At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
At last it stopped.
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on table’s falling
At Simeon’s he’s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
At first they’d nothing seen In common.
At usual hour stirred up, In candle’s light she’s getting up.
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtain’s moving
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
At Kharitónya’s in the alley In front of house at the gate
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
At last she’s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
At the beginning of my novel — (In chapter first you look it all)
At margins of the books she’s meeting Of reader’s pencil slightest signs:
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret torment’s gladness...
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
At the games of maidenhood.
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
At any sides we’ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
At once was frightened my Tatyana...
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame You’d guess, as I would well behave
At Verrey’s every morning’s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
At first his language me confused,
At rocks of the Caucasian districts
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
At brook the monument is seeing She’s drawing made of leather rein,
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
At fire-place the table’s lain: Onegin’s waiting - Lensky’s speeding
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
At boring aunt’s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: ‘I’ve my happy days...’
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricks…
At goose’s neck a skull is fateful, It’s whirling round for all sides;
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
At such a year, such an age.
At him she stares all the way:
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
At sister Tanya isn’t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
At neighbour’s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
At window alone, sad (Diana’s ray lights up, her wakens)
At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
At her much frightened loud cries
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
Away from Eugene’s lips; morose, He’s awkward, hardly has he force
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
Baratynsky.
Became alredy quite inapt.
Because ire, truthfulness she’s swift? Because from heavens got as gift
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
Because she’s innocent and plain,
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forest’s thicks?
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
Be glad with such a man… You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun he’s looking on...
Before arrival; anyhow She isn’t bothered (that’s female!);
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
Behind the mill.
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
Believe, I’d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
Bewildered and astonished hard...
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
Boom could fade.
‘Bordeaux’ all the times!
Brothers!
‘But who is she?’ She is my wife,
But really?
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
But will it come, my day of freedom?
‘But do you love, indeed, the other?’ -And what? -
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
But wretched is, who’s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
‘But I’d prefer another,
But suddenly was changed it all:
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, You’ll never leave me such unfit.
‘But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyana’s husband just appears,
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
But now, friends, from all my sides -
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
But Hymen’s troubles, griefs of mating,
But road alarm of love then filled me.
‘But who? plump general that big?’
But they would madden it too hard.
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
But are you listening yet to me?
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
But then your horse will try in fear
But never wanted to correct; To censorship I’ll pay my debt;
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already
But She whom I yet don’t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
But where now through them speeds
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
But let me help with sacred water.
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young lover’s lot:
But Tanya now like in dream
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet she’s looking rather slim;
But it is late, it’s time to go...
But in gloomy cliffs
But at least
But hero, I’m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
But where are you? Come! My rights
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
But landlords of the country’s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..’
But his such sufferable shade,
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
But can’t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
But you are tortured by the road.
But I can hardly drag my feet,
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
-But no one...
But even such a friendship, readers, We haven’t now; each of us
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
‘But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
But I am ready to refuse As its translation isn’t easy.
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
But doesn’t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
But shall I see you?’ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
But by your narrow small tracks,
But now - God! - is cooling blood
But Tanya’s heart yet isn’t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,
But withered!
But summer’s flying quicker yet.
But she’s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty’s letter I should use.
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future won’t be
But you forgive him, games in stillness!
But I
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
But now doubts all are solved:
’But may be she’s in love?’ ‘Who knows?
‘But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
But yet she can’t.
But well, she’s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister’s pretty grace,
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures won’t be the best.
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
But I… it doesn’t bother me: To old times I’ll loyal be.
But then with books she could be dealing.
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
But like a house all deserted It’s dark and still, and not by chance
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
But many days away could get
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
But Latin’s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
But send your boy, and first of all’ .
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
But you are pale... What are you feeling? ‘It’s nothing, nanny, not at all.
But he’s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
‘But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?’
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
-But what is it -
But soon for husband, all at once,
But why? I don’t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
But now...
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse already’s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, it’s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!
But now radiant moon’s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
But forward, forward, you, my story!
-But what about?
But, seems to me I’d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory.
But my fate
But uncoordinated volumes From devil’s library all got,
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
But then a frenchman took her place.
But what I’d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
But how greatly Tanya’s altered!
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What’s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
But something more us separated...
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
But dangerous for the maiden’s heart) Quite reddenning he’s missing up.
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
But with Tatyana shan’t we guess.
But may be those kinds of pictures By now can’t you all attract,
But hist!
‘But trouble is: they are such bores’.
But other times in mind I bear!
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
But it’s enough to speak of her:
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runs… the bear’s after her!
But no answer...
But to no person In all the world I’d give my heart,
‘But how did you marry, nanny?’ -It was by wish of God.
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
But what severe!
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
But that’s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
But after first cordial greeting Zaretsky’s silent for a while
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
But whom to love?
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
But why Talyana should be guilty?
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
But none she had!
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
But can’t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades’ spectres
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
But suddenly her sister’s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0
‘But now tell;’ she says, ‘to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?’
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
Buyánov courted: was refused.
Buyánov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
Byron
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, she’s standing still.
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
By winter carpets, snow-made.
By dreadful exclamation Onegin’s shuddered; slain, impatient
By night’s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
By clear smile the nature’s fitting Through dream the year’s morning meeting
By habits of the life he’s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
By new one can’t I be admired I pity old one - it’s true.
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
By bondage Lensky’s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
By Olga’s hand the tea’s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyana’s standing, She’s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted window’s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With Göttingen in soul frankly,
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novel’s beings,
By sorcery of story’s secrets!
By nothing bound, I’m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
By him were left at your employments.
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
By hard from big Tambóv’s engaged; Buyhánov whirls with Pustyakóva,
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
By got by Olga strange tuition She’s touched, in depth of soul sighs;
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness who’s admired?
By many signs she’s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,

Came in.
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
Can’t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
Can’t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;
Child-Harold’s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forest’s still
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
Could me enjoy... I’ve had my fill; It is enough!
Could my Onegin now find.
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didn’t join the guild existent
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry,
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
‘D’you think.’ indeed... suspicions any… But do you see...
D’you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
D’you hear?
- D’you joke -
D’you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?’
D’you know?...
Dear! come to rue… As in a dream it seems to be...
Decayed...
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
Decided is.
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winter’s bliss and tinges all:
Deserted room alone filling You read; it’s Pradt, it’s Walter Scott.
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
Diana’s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
Did try to make of that some fun: The country’s freedom has its own
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
Dmitriyev.
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
Do not reflect Diana’s features, Recalling bygone novel’s creatures,
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
‘Do not.’
Do comme il faut… (Shishkov, forgive; can’t some good translation give).
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
Each shutter’s open, and dry
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
Each topic’s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
Each minute more is captivated By Olga’s beauty so young,
Each claps.
Effects, but stepped away anew; He’s blessed much more, who never knew
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, he’s admired;
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole world…
Enough, my dear...
‘Enough, get up, I now must
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
Enough... and has been done the burden:
Enough, my friend, its all the same!
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
Etcetera.
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
Eugene’s letter to Tatyana
Every country eater
Exactly...
Explain to you, do it frankly.
Expresses death but not the torture.
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
Forgive!
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanya’s dear heart indeed.
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
‘Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
Forgive me’.
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
Forgive me, isn’t it too hard?’ -For me it’s not - ‘But dear bard,
Forgive, secluded my asylum!
‘Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
Forgotten features can remind.
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soul’s filled
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
For her he’s looking on... for nought...
For changes fated anyhow...
For garden now we shall fleet In which she’s got with him to meet.
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;
For long is weeping she this time.
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maiden’s dreams.
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
For theatre Onegin’s speeding. In it each man is free at all:
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
For how long?
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
For flying glory don’t long.
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
For love she’s dedicated truly Like loyal child for mother’s nest,
For evening whist who’s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (That’s all he knew in own world...)
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
For centures to make him known.
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
For husband then she was yet bride.
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
For nowhere am I smart...
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
For thoughtful singing with attention?’
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
‘For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
For what and where do I strive?
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
For all of that
For evening party...
For tears, rhymes and so on?… Present me her’.
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
‘For single winter it will do, At least I’ll credit money you’…
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
For you the glory and the laud, The father’s land, incarceration?
For fair of the brides her bring,
For his delight were just awaiting.
For long has chance with us to be?
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadn’t time
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
Four fatal for the life the stages...
«Freischutz» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
From novel’s only beginning — I’ve finished now chapter one.
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
From glass not stopping For a while’. He never kisses hands of ladies,
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
From mountains descends this way
From bed Onegin wasn’t moving, The dream yet flies about him.
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;
From two to thirty years on; The district dandy Petushkóv,
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages don’t want.
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
Go on!
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
Goodness me!
Goodness me, it isn’t For him to hear!
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
Grand treaty’s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
Great charm to any conversation.
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children you’d be seeing
Griboyedov
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
H’m, h’m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk o’key?
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
Haphazard wander to prevent.
Has come; to servant says he will Lepage’s fatal barrels steady
Has found end untimely hard!
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar’s gone.
Has fallen…
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maiden’s.
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
Have less in difference between Each one.
Have been decayed in nature’s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
Healthy all...
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
He didn’t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
He’s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lensky’s head For sufferings, he here had.
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
He’s killed!..
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;
He was afraid of being answered
He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry.
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
He, might be, for the world’s welfare Or even for the fame was born;
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
He stepped away... he turned a bit..’-
He’s blessed, who with his love combined
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
He’ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
He’s always frowned, taciturn, He’s chilly, jealous, angry turned!
He came, What news, such sentimental!
He’s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
He’s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
He hasn’t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
He’s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He’s blessed, who well in time was ripe.
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she can’t have breath..
He’s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
He’s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasn’t right at all
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
He opened a door."
He couldn’t be a bard for ever, He didn’t go mad or die,
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
He’s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
He’s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
He didn’t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
He was mistaken: sleeping fair — Onegin then for world was dead,
He doesn’t gather them with horn. A maiden’s singing in her house,
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
He’s not been seen, none word from dear;
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
He thinks of here:
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
He can’t give happiness at large’.
He’s trembling, loses fitting words, He’s happy, has improved his health,
He’s now languished by remorse, He’s being ready to beg pardon,
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
He looks al her with tender ardour; He’s yet beloved with previous force,
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
He shouts: ‘Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
He isn’t here...
He looks, he calls him - all’s for nothing!
He cast a glance at ladies’ tires, At circles but with looks, attires
He slept and coffee had he here, His menager’s reports could hear,
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
He isn’t more… The youngling bard
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
He can’t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
He’ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
He doesn’t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
He’s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
He hurries up to ring.
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
He liked the grove’s timid thickness,
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
He’s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
He differed people in effect, And other’s passions could respect.
He trembles... to princess he’s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
He’s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tama’s heart.
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drums’s beat.
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
He’s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kant’s ideas and his moves.
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
’He’s ignoramus’, said the neighbours, ’He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
‘Here’s He! that’s Eugene!
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
Her face but has of wrath a track...
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
Her tired look and slipped away...
Her husband’s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
Her husband comes.
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
Her head to shoulder’s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
Her tender fingers didn’t dare To take a needle; she could never
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
Her role how firmly played,
Her maiden’s mirror yet she keeps.
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
His epigram’s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
His life’s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
His nets for them were so frightening!
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
His verse is sluggish and obscure (It’s called romanticism by us;
His lunch him answered with politeness.
His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
His own works?
His morbid and quite dying look,
His letter’s here, quite exact.
His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC.
His father didn’t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
His pistol then Onegin raises
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
His misty, foggy gaze
His soul’s warmed with inspiration By lady’s greetings, friendly kind.
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each other’s brains;
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
His look was always quick and tender,
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -
His Olga’s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
His ardent talk was full of haze;
Hor
How would you not love Moscow?
Hurra! we all have reached the land.
I write it, as for long my time I haven’t any sin of mine.
‘I fell in love... you’d get away
‘I fell in love’, again she whispers In nurse’s ear in dismay.
I can’t foresee any objection To this representation made.
I have without any doubts Tatyana’s letter to translate.
I had happened To know many old legends,
‘I’ll be defender; I’ll not endure when offender
I don’t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
I know: Parny’s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?
I’ve heard some voice of new desire, I’ve got new sorrow anew;
I’m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
I…’ -But you are boring
I
III
-I’m glad. - ‘but when?’ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
I know, you were sent by goodness, You’ll be my guard until the end,
I’m sorry that you go… well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
II
I don’t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
‘I don’t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
I
II

III
I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
I stop!
I dread to read again...
I live and write not for applause,
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
I don’t grudge: why should I grudge?
‘I’ll perish, - says my Tanya’s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.
I see you strong already!

I’m unknown...
I’ll take a look and then turn’,
I
I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what d’you think? again collapse!’
I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
I’d like to use the Alban’s model: In Petersburg to show ball.
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII
I could define
I haven’t force... is tired breast…
I was taking you in hands!
I’ve read it up:
III
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
II
I
I’ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,
‘I’m not quite made to be much happy. My soul’s alien for bliss;
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used I’d run from you;
I write, and heart yet isn’t boring, The pen unwitting isn’t drawing
I’m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/
I

III
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
I love him, he’s my kin in-law.
I don’t mean to please grand people.
I was embittered, he… unfit.
I liked his features in the past:
I was his friend some while ago.
I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,
‘I see, in world you’ve been too rare...
‘I’m neighbour just’.
I’d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.
I saw myself in cherished dream
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armid’s pretty lips,
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
I like teenage’s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
I’d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
I can foresee: you’ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
I didn’t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready
I’ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you I’m dangling:
I prize my hours, my days: But I’m in idle boredom wasting
I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
I dread: in my submissive prayers You’ll see by strict, severe gaze
III
I can’t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.

I’m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
I ask: be patient for a time;
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
‘I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
III
I love you (why should I be cunning?).

I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
I — It sparkles by Hippocrene’s role, It was by own play and foam

Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
Ideal image, Tanya’s rhyme...
If by the family best vision For instant I’d be charmed with reason,-
‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
If she’s seeing
If not... if not, let God deliver!
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
If I were poet like you.
If you could know, what’s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
If their district visits on?
Imagine: I’m alone, thus From no man have understanding...
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
Importantly repeats for doll The mother’s lessons, though small.
Impossible!?
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
‘Indeed? - my Eugene’s now thinking, - But is it true?..
Indeed, by magnetism’s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
Indeed, you won’t With all your pure flaming heart
Indeed, for long should have the end!
Indeed, d’you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
Indeed, he’s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isn’t fading,
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.
In languish of the loving bounds He’s spending now day and night.
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
In man’s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
In letters though he again
In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
In dark my Tanya’s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
In fear I was crying, darling,
In winter, when the night’s weak shade
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
In own dreams all’s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
In Tanya’s, Olga’s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
In fear shameful heart is sinking.
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
-In this I see yet no troubles…
In front of him gay fancy’s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
In village, in forgotten stillness Of you I’d never know, thus I wouldn’t know tortures sleepless.
In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
In sledge he’s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soul’s quiet dream.
In wonder style To every place he came in time.
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
In duels classic, pedant cross
In many trends he’d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
In hands I have Tatyana’s letter. It’s kept by me with sacred sigh.
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
In book’s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
In brackets I would like to note: You haven’t more insulting lie,
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
In horror Tanya is awaking...
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
In country tedium’s prevailing Without palaces or streets,
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
In early spring of every year.
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
In vain I try to be aware,
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself I’ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
In crowd everybody renders:
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
In country’s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
In life with us like new it’s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But let’s return to lady sitting.
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
In talks all’s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
In young sad soul’s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
In tender manner they agree.
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
In them you can’t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
In his first youth he was untrained,
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
In actions husband’s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
In deserts of the heaven’s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
In them I’ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
In brackets to the point I’d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirror’s aiming down,
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
In them he draws the country whole, The Kyprid’s temple, graves alone:
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashion’s duty,
In all of them restriction’s queer; Antiquity the old backs.
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shiller’s work.
Invitations for a meeting?
Is spoiled by old duels fan, He’s evil, gossip, talking man...
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
Is flying from the waxy cell.
Is cunning liric, who can render
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
Is he the same or quiet now?
Is really the secret’s found?
Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
Is whitening on Lukérya Lvovna, The same yet lies Lytibóv Petróvna.
Is drawn, in turn I’ve bad nay time.
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
Is not it so, friend?
Is pictured rather well correctly With his immoral soul wry,
Is it because in higher circles
Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
Is it not
Is it high time as I forgot
Is he a parody not yet?
Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
Istómina’s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
Italian nights I shall adore.
Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!’
Its worth of fine and charming soul,
Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!
Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss they’ve had;
Its dark.
Its here: take it and be ‘tackling’ !) All look like silver snowy fields...
Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it’s all the same.
Its time for dinner, Guests have had
Its time! - I everyday appeal.
Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
It is forgivable.
It’s right.
It’s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
It’s time to leave for life the tight
It’s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
It now; but ‘Bordeaux’ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
It means the following thing mainly:
‘It’s mine!’ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
It’s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
It’s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
It was well known friendly wellcome:
It’s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
It’s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
It shows traceries affective, Informs of mind’s the secret backs.
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
«It’s time to change them in a body,
It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
It’s winter!..
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
It’s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his mother’s finger shakes.
It’s signed by t.a.v.
It might he other: he’d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
It’s all decided (it’s my version) By heavens board: I’m yours at heart.
It’s late.
It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
It’s dark in valleys.
It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
It’s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
It’s both harmful and absorbing.
It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I can’t be appraising,
It’s striking ten; he’s driving out. He’s flying... now he’s at porch.
‘It’s seven soon, it’s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to wait’.
It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
It’s mute for ever all at once.
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
It’s time, its time to marry her!
It’s better place for passing letters fit.
It in strain
It all is still.
Iván Petróvich’s fool and bore, Semyón Petróvich stints yet more;
-Just solemn odes you could hear!
Just He! His gaze on her he’s fixing, Like dreadful shade for her he’s reaching,
K. Vyasemsky.
Khandra pursued him, always waiting,

La morale est dans 					la natura des choses.
La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui i’morir non dole.
Last evening frightful words I’d heard; Thank God!
‘Left side?.. but where? what is there?’ I ‘It doesn’t matter, but you look,
Lensky saw
Less influence on lady’s head; It was, my friends, Martyn Zadeka,
Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,
Let’s turn the route we now here To keep in mind of whom I sing...
Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,
-Let’s go.- They were quietly driven,
Let it be so: you have had
Let us play inventfully, Lot us play more happily,
Let’s visit them; you’ll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself:
Let’s read
Let’s listen, yet without labour, To their talking, short indeed.
Let give the God his soul chances
Let me look back.
Let’s come together... take a rest...
Let’s go, do thorn such a favour!
Let’s away get rapidly, Him bespatter easily
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while he’s sleeping,
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
Like in van Dick’s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, she’s boon
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winter’s even every way.
Like Julie’s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
Like North Aurora’s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
Like thoughts of simple lady’s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
Like Byron, poet of grace. Or it’s impossible or faithless
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
Like women, books were all left here,
Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
Like crank by chance at feast enormous He’s angry.
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.
Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
Like victim under charming veil.
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
Like Harold Child Onegin’s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon
Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,
Lord Byron with his whim successful Enveloped fussy egoism In hopeless romanticism.
‘Lord! to her!..
Lornette his captious he has got,
Lornette his double slantwise renders To see all ladies to be fit,
Love-letter secrets on six sheets, The fraud, the gossip, rings, the tears,
Made all young heart to pine away, For someone did her soul wait.
Maiden’s Song
Maiden’s singing intimate, Don’t peep invisibly
Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,
Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isn’t frozen by frost.
Malfilatre.
Maliciously discuss with smiles: If I was sharp or dull in lies,
Malvina’s works but separated For several roubles he abated,
Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,
Marmontel’s volume them he gave.
Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever
May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream
May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.
May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?
May be, you saw at Neva’s banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.
Mazurka’s sounding.
Mazurka is the crowd’s choice; All round are crush and noise;
Mazurka now all its rating, Initiative beauties keeps:
Meantime account, made for you, In details I shall give to you,
Meanwhile some two or three of pages (Some idle gibberish or fables,
Meanwhile far off The honest person and Zaretsky
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning, His bolivar he’s having on	{3]
Meanwhile we all. of Hymen foes, In home life yet see but one
Meanwhile they most be not a mock, But honourable..!’ - l could here
Meanwhile the moon was brightly shining, By languid light it was enlightning
Meanwhile his eyes off her can’t tear Some general important, grand.
Meanwhile
Meanwhile small foot in hands l feel;
Meanwhile her soul’s feelings moan, Her tears filled her languid glance...
Meanwhile with cold sham to dare To force the speech and look with mock
Meanwhile the Cyclops of the village In front of dimmish forge’s light
Meanwhile in life you try to revel, As much as I you take form it!
Meanwhile Onegin’s stay at Larin’s Was estimated like a news,
‘Me?’ - Yes, Tatyana’s name-day happy Will be on Saturday...
Moldavia, that’s far away From Italy, was end of way.
Monotonous and sometimes yet senseless, Like whirlwind of the youthful lives,
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere, To give the boy some chance to rest,
Monsieur Triquet is on the floor, In jersey, capped, not far from door.
More pretty than a parquette fashioned, The river, clad in ice, is flashy,
More brave than sound man, a grand His message wants to send: weak hand
More sweet, than joys beneath the moon, Will stay of Torkwat’s octaves tune!
Most be respected for the life. And true girl-friend in love’s adjustment
Much more... -
Much longer now she is hiking, But now brook and now hill
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
My bad translation incomplete. Its like of picture poor copy; Or like of
My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;
My Lensky’s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.
My disillusioned lornette, Of joy some careless spectator,
My poets! I’d like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear
My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine I’ve shooting things.
My muse new person just reveals.
My dashing Eugene?
My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.
My dear early little bird!
My poor Tanya sits, can’t sleep, And looks into the darkling field.
My Moscow... in this lunation
My God! what thoughts could come to him!’
My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed,
My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, I’m husband yours by love!"
My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard.
My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift
My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead?
-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-
My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth,
My cousin dear, Sit down... complex is the life!
My God, a scene from novels dear...’ -And that’s my daughter...
My friends, on bard you’d have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime
My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.
My Tanya’s hugged by their daughters.
My memory is dark.., I’m granny... And much forgot... of life the line
‘My habit,..
My dear God, you bless and save!
My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here
’My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait.
My Eugene’s standing As if by thunder has been struck,
My father gave consent to wed.
My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever.
My Vanny Was younger, than myself I mean, And I was, dear, yet thirteen.
My muse in ethics well embodied!
My greetings!
‘My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living,
My student’s cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit,
‘My dreams and years won’t rather Return to make me new a bit,
My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;
My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!
My age inclines for strict a prose, Against light rhymes my age arose
My poor mind...
Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things.
New way I’m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.
New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:
New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision
Next day has come...
Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
None soul’s seen in rooms at entrance...
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
‘No’.
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She’d catch one’s eyes by simple face.
Nor makes get up without choosing.
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Lady’s Fashion Journal had
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
- Not, then!
Not madrigals my Lensky’s writing In Olga’s album, and indeed
Not a word can slip
Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
Not...
Not Eugene he’s at most?
Not grasping ways to understand
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles brings’
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can’t adhere
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.
Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful,
O , rus!
O’key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me!
O Russia!
Of words for songs of prairie districts...
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.
(Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired Flyánov,
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
‘Of whom your own lyre sighs?’ By you I’m often briskly questioned, -
Of lively lucid verse’s glow,
Of multiplied his own crank.
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend I’m now singing,
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,
Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.
Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.
Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pull…
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
Of course, Onegin’s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
Of what a languor’s full her breast?
Of men, whom I can’t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendship’s heavy haze?
Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,
Of higher world the queer ladies!
Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?
Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
Of praised grandfather’s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
Of Moscow young graces good
Of ballet’s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels
Of known ladies feet and legs.
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
Of love mad sufferings she’s feeling . Without ceasing for a while
Of looking back she doesn’t dare And hurries up, she’s quickening steps,
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
Of young delirium high rage.
Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didn’t come at all to him
Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But it’s a stress
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
Of legislator of the halls?
Of tyrant you didn’t fear, But now he your fate has had.
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladies’ hearts.
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:
Of poet, who’s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;
Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-
Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.
Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maiden’s album big,
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
‘Of them my Olga is the younger.
Of stylish words some ready set?
Of agitated soul’s feelings
Of tears tracks?..
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:
Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
Of course, he thinks, ‘I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;
Of enemy from pistol parried.
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journal’s call:
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughter’s bed till day was dreaming
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
Of elegy’s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
Of yard boys family just flies.
Of ‘Clicquot widow’ or ‘Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintly’.
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead you’ll give a hope;
Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
Of mind some vague a thought is moving...
Of own life he could forget!
Of humble girl some secret love?
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the country’s still!
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why
Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply -
Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,
Of life her features have but few.
Of daily troubles.
Of grievous notes of the heart.
Of mind some cold observations,
Of course, of him I’ll quickly know,- For him I now haven’t time.
Of years young but whithered hard,
Of dear friends a pretty chat.
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
Of bold children’s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!
Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,
Oh, don’t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
One’s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
Onegin’s quick to dress. Already His sernant’s ordered to be ready
Onegin’s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
Onegin got Tatyana’s message. It quickly touched his soul’s strings:
Onegin’s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
Onegin’s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
Onegin.
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
Onegin’s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
Onegin’s coining with excuses.
Onegin’s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
Onegin’s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
Onegin’s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.
On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.
On steps of world the bard might go
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanya’s shoulder he bends;
On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,
On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid let’s have dinner before rest!
On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...
On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, He’s taking home dreadful hoard,
On river’s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
On leave the gussars hasten here
On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snow’s filthy
On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,
On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,
On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,
On earth, then might be by her love She’d joined the friends the day above!
On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind
On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
On jade postillion’s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beard’s shaggy.
On table’s hissing yet, forlorn...
Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!
Opinion of the public mournful!
Opinions of the worldly might...
Or will he be a lad good natured Like you and I, like all the world?
Or Cleopatra may encore (By others to be heard once more).
Or, as before, he plays the crank?
Or Idol mio; dropped by chance On fire journals or his pumps.
Or can he see forgotten foes, Some cravens, slanderers, a swarm
Or may be guessed from far away That uncle his would pass away.
Or not for long her heart was shattered
Or village house - at the pane Is sitting she.., and she again!,.
Or when a worm disdained and deadly Is growing out lily’s stem
Or could be poet with reasons (And I confess - could favour me).
Or aren’t we glad to see returning Of perished in the autumn leaves
Or with the nature just reviving We close in, confused by minding
Or, like in fever, can he get A touch of hand, or helps to go
Or, like coquette, he simply boomed? By his good will Or willy-nilly
Or where Thalia’s stilly dreaming To friendly claps yet isn’t listening;
Or where Terpsichore one Amazes all the public young
Or on the lyre draws a dove With pens and paints, with all his love;
Or on the leaves for recollections, Of other signatures beneath
Or am I stranger to enjoyments, To all that gladdens and revives,
Or tenderer - like little moth Which sucks spring flower with force;
Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.
Or vagrant Melmoth, such distressful, Or Corsair, or Eternal Jew,
Or really she guessed not wrong?
Or otherwise I’d be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-
Or dismal eye will never find
Or even own demon mine. Onegin (him I’ll occupy),
Or kind of madcap; sad a version Of some Satanic ugly person,
Or that’s because all my disgrace Would eyes attract to you, belated,
Or Sbogar, mythical a few.
Or sleeping over the Lethe The poet is quiet, easy,
Or Baratinsky with his pen,- Let be you birnt by thunder then!
Or in the garden hand in hand They walk at morning so grand;
‘Pachette!’- Alina!
Past clans; the charming dreams of love, Antique moralities beloved.
Perfections yours make speech my gappy, Of them I’m not yet worthy, miss.
Perhaps I’ll grieve if in a while
Perhaps, you would agree, that is By marble charms unable Nina
Perhaps, in front of portrait famous, To people future ignoramous
Perhaps, in Lethe won’t perish My verse, by wit and heart well made;
Petrarka 			Where days are cloudy and short 			A tribe was there born 			For which to die makes no hurt. (It.)
Philosopher among his mates With them his room he decorates.
Pm sure... none, They’ll be the family, the one.
Polite; with sharp-clawed paw he’s rapping Her hand to offer help; she bends
Possesses half of world existing Much longer, in the softened loom
Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud
Prepare ruins once for ever...
Presents his friend and distant kin.
- Princess, mon ange! -
Princess, undone yet before him
Princess is staring at him...
Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
Ran up and not without fighting
Rather well The grove sleeps.
Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
Regards of them to you I’m giving.
Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaid’s.
Reminiscence of old time, Of maiden’s room!
Replace the fortune.
Report for him was so sudden From steward:
Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
Rousseau (I’d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Sad and cold,
Says yes or no, never да-с Or нет-с’(the words, they all would pass).
‘Sed alia temporal’ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
Shall see emotional flight?
‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Perhaps,’ says Lensky.
Shall I again your chorus hear?
‘Shall go forth or should return?..
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
She runs for forest... he’s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
She doesn’t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
She’s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldn’t give a hoot..
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
She doesn’t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
She’s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesn’t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
She’s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
She’s up at once, Like shade she’s pale, but no answer...
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
She went away.
She’s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
She’s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foe’s hand
She doesn’t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isn’t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
She hurries up to have a chat.
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,
She’s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
She’s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
She’s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
She courted… at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
She all is trembling, paling, shying.
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
She’s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, she’s often frightened,
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinter’s crackling making light.
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
She’s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
She’s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
She enters a deserted yard.
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
She doesn’t say: ‘Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
She looks, and all her own heart More often’s heating and more hard.
She thinks:
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian “н” in French best manner
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
She’s after me.
She sees: the room is light again, Through window’s a frosty pane
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly
She’s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
She’s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
She’s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
She’s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugene’s kept in mind,
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
She doesn’t glare at the rest, And doesn’t claim to have success;
She’s not astonished, hasn’t anger...
She’s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
She falls on snow - he is swifty: He’s taking her in paws and brings,
She’s running - he is after her; She can’t be running any more,
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
Should I begin my freedom flight.
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
Sincerely, in grief embracing
Slipshod result of my pastimes,
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
Some cold wind just blows.
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Neva’s stream,
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
Some loss in all the song’s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: ‘Ah!’ But he becomes
Some other...
Some real honour and the pride.
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
Some foreign words, she often writes.
Some noise by beetle’s raised.
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
Some tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,’ to thinks
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
Some several miles from Krasnogóry, From Lensky’s village, there lives
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady’s album if by chance,
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
Sometimes she’s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola I’ll travel
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
Such charming, tender.
Such custom’s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
Such time what can you do in village?
Such men (I’m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
Such subject’s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
Surprises deeply all his reeling?
THE END
Tanya, near!
‘Tanya though!’ ‘D’you know her?-
Tatyana’s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
Tatyana trusted legend’s fancies Of simple folk’s old times.
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesn’t know why)
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
Tatyana’s flushing, all she’s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
Tatyana’s interest is affected By melting on the fire wax:
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this world’s fuss she’s hatred feeling.
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
Tatyana’s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
Tatyana hadn’t any trends To play with them in any weather:
Tatyana’s letter to Onegin.
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
Tatyana steeps.
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter’s trembling on her palm, The wafer’s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify
Tell again, You see, I’m now muddle-headed.
Thank God, more clearly - she’s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.
That uhlan’s loved by all her soul… At altar now does she stand
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
That he’s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
That dream aroused her misgivings.
That’s what I am.
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
That was the way of Eugene’s thinking.
That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
That instant I could trunk with reason
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
That’s why in French she’s always writing.
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
That recently I was you christening?’
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
That time, when in lyceum’s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
That time to all my childish dreams
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
The doubts all confused her soul:
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
The morning pleasant noise arose.
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
The talkative my lyre’s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
The evening sky’s more dark.
The waters Are still.
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
The fisher’s fire.
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
The hall is full of crowd; The music’s weary of sound;
The heaven’s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
The capital’s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
The woman says:
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasn’t smoothed by any chance:
The way to keep her man away! And everything became o’key.
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
The snow-drift at once is moving...
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
The fire-place is fading...
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
The evening darkness comes along...
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields she’s now looking:
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga Petushkóv then whirls,
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
The youthful years would be fading, The soul’s heat would not be hot
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
The clock’s been striking
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
The boy was frisky but with grace.
The further I’m from youth my gay,
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
The Gulnare’s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
The foes put the capes on steppe.
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
The pistols all are now shining, The hammer’s jingling at the lock,
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquet’s cracks wee heard again.
The tea’s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
The enmity’s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier she’s liking us,
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heaven’s blue
The hamlet, where Eugene’s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
The foes!
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.
The ‘else’s trends’, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
The mistress cries, ‘At last you’ve got!’
The love’s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
The master’s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
The coachman’s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
The field is dark in pretty gale...
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
The girls are jumping all around.
The colonel sent it for the chance.
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
The same is dog, the same’s her man Which is of club the loyal number,
The inns are absent.
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
The sledge for race is now ready, In it he’s flying to the mill;
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horses’ stall…’
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
The shining skies are now blued.
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you I’m staunch a friend.
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
The tears of the people’s awe. Katenin there could restore
The snow’s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
The beds are made. And any guest
The same I was in time of wisdom,
The day had gone, but no answer...
The shades of night are now rare And Vesper’s met by cock ahead.
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
The withering of own days, Which can’t revive by any ways?
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
The wish of heart to whisper her.
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
The first of leaflets just can show: Qu’ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
The heart of somebody he’ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!’… -To whom, my dear?
The autumn golden is coming, The nature’s now trembling, pale
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. — Hut now simply good the head
The letter’s ready, has been fit...
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
The head of Chaldean wise men, — Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
The ashes patriarchal honoured.
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
The novel’s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,
The shepherd’s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
The folly’s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasn’t right.
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
The novelty with ages smacks.
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heaven’s bodies light
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larin’s soon forever went:
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
The first he made - he left you all;
The spring of honour, idol last!
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at river’s banks they fall.
The snow’s crackling... someone’s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
The fire’s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coal’s crust;
The seasons country views
The vice, that’s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
The prince as if anew him sees:
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
Then we’ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
Then he for her a chair’s finding, They speak about this and that,
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden’s names by names from France,
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
‘There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!’
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
They all replaced for each of roberts; The tea’s been brought.
They’ve made me marry other man; And I’ll be true to him till end!
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
They say, they’d got For that the best in world reward.
They joked, not without sin At Tanya’s suitor made a hint.
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
They’d better laugh before they had
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
They laugh; the guests are now coming.
They don’t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
They didn’t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
They say, you are a lone guy, In country’s stillness you are boring.
They argue louder; he’s getting Some long a knife; in short a while
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfast’s ready in the room.
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
They don’t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
They rush into the yard at once!
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
They friends became.
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
This kind of book yet doesn’t show The writer’s fancies in a row,
This way my Eugene was her teaching.
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
This news Tatyana quickly hears.
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests it’s always zealous,
Three houses will wait for him.
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for river’s crook.
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
Through tears never seeing him,
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
Together for a time they sit.
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
To walk?
To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
To loose his colour he’s beginning: She doesn’t see or she’s too hard!?
To hostess a lady’s heading, Some plump grand general’s behind.
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasn’t grasping.
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistol’s cock.
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesn’t slumber,
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olga’s frock.
To take it up she can’t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
To have remorse I haven’t forces; Like Bogdanovich’s all verses I’d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
To have a talk with her he tried
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
To other things let’s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
To make your dear magic tuning Of beauty’s passion mood, resuming
To whom my vice is not a harm?
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
To inner porch he goes fast, He’s laying down her at last.
To meet the scholar world’s desire I could describe, you’d be amazed.
To him she doesn’t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
- To pour half-glass you do a favour...
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;
To Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuse
To call some people gets away.
To Moscow, they need good things.’..,
To guess the windy youth is trying
To judgings by the world severe
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
To scratch unfaithful icy path As he’s afraid to fall at last.
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressed».
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!’
To comfort sorrow and grief.
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
To leave the world I would he sorry.
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
To meet princess.
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I’d like to write,
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
-To Larin’s -’Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings daily…
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
To write about otherself As if about ownself?
To ride a horse in steppe severe?
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didn’t read,
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
To them He paid his all attention then.
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
To come to tables hand in hand.
‘To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?’
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
To me true compass now lend
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he’s a dunce.
To cry, to weep I’m now ready...’ -I see, you are unwell already
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
To you I’m greatful!
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
‘To me you wrote, Do not deny.
To get him up she isn’t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
Too long the silence’s now seeming...
To keep the happy stirrup dare...
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
To protests of soul’s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
To tell you all, what he had known, I haven’t any time at all.
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
To Lensky he could listen smiling.
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
To me that time you were quite right,’ To you is grateful soul mine...
To all these letters, tears, deeds...
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
‘To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
To-morrow we’ll Tanya show...
To be with you I cannot go...
To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
To have a rest and have a hike, That’s why I’ll finish other time.
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
To you I’ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
To answer her.
To touch in splendid admiration.
To play the cards was used with me.
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!’
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you’d like, Or Eden to itself’s unlike.
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
To fix her fate it’s time, I see;
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence now’s keeping.
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
Two pistols in a row,
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
“Uncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew he’d be glad”.
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
Unlucky victim, Lensky’s gone...
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
Unmoving, lone he’s again.
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow’s languid peace.
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: He’s blessed, who knew all their pretty
Unwittingly in mirror’s peeping Ashamed to recognize: he’s beaten;
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
Upstairs to the highest rate.

Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry.
‘Vladimir Lensky here’s lain, He met his death like man quite hold
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
Was talking much of them with pride.
Was brave instead of ‘elle Nina’ To put the ‘belle Tatiana’
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, We’ll call him dandy for the forth.
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being The heir of all relatives in trust.
Was too afraid, I must confess...
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
Was asking Olya him at once
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
We knew the game of passion’s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
We haven’t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
We them remind about us...
We must meanwhile
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
We’ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
We sing of their lucky fate And glory!
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
‘Well, he is killed’,- the neighbour said.
‘Well... I, my nanny… don’t know... For love I’m longing, dear me!
‘Well, no, just the same...
‘Well, dear me, what is the matter?
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
Well, many trifles like the bra.
Well dressed, she’s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
Well, I remember... has he gone?
Well, I saluted classicism! It’s late, but preface has been seen.
Well have the music regimental!
Well, to present you I shall try’
‘Well, let us go…’ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul’s haze.
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, I’d like with you
What will he choose for his engagement?
‘What slow-witted you are, nyanya!’ -I’m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barin’s will I’d rather…-
‘What’s happened?’- `Nothing’… - Gets away.
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
‘What for you early disappeared?’
What is your name? - He’s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphon…
What does the kinsfolk mean namely?
What was the sequence of the meeting?
What roses, you can be judging,
What happened, what a strange a dreamt
What for would ever view
‘What, you are married! didn’t know!
What kind’s he now anyhow?
What more you want?
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?
What for yet here has he been?
What languid is her gaze guile charming:
What’s use?
What a whim...
What do you want to ask, you say!
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
‘What way?
What does next day for me prepare?
What’s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
What purpose?
What?
What blunder! I’m a punished ranger.
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
What joy: to-day we’ll have to dance!
What foolish, dumpy is this place!
What’s the end?
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
What for you visited all us?
What shall I do, I can’t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
‘What big is Tanya!
What for to grieve?
-What said the satirist, remember!
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
What’s my Onegin?
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hare’s trembling
When he’s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshky’s sounds hear),
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
When in the garden’s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?’
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
‘Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
Where we have never been.
Where is it better?
Where’s agitation And honourable aspiration
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
Which doesn’t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I can’t...
Which’s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
While he prefered to play a steed. His finger’s frozen a little,
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
While she’s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
While at the moon Tatyana’s looking, By own heart away she’s gone...
‘Whith Olga what could happen?
Whom don’t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
Whom you’d be trusting?
Who isn’t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
Who’s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
Who’s that, which never us betrays?
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
‘Who might be thinking... all the time!
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla’s crowned there.
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
Who’s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
Who father’s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
Who left Tambóv without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
Who’s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
Who’s he?
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
Who never bores us by his charm?
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
Who’s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?’,
Who carefully us can cherish?
Who helps from slander not to perish?
Whose author bolter nature’s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
’Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
Why! out of the country thickets...’
Why not? It’s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It’s poet of grace!’
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
Will take the twilight of my days.
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards they’ll not endure
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
With age the life is such a badness...’
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
With reason I remembered them.
With which to start?
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky
With heavenly her pride she’s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
With you I now tears shed;
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarka’s language ‘I love you’ .
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goethe’s, Shiner’s places hiking,
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isn’t seeing;
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
With might and main he’ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
With age to argue is unfitness; The custom’s despot of the males.
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
With love friends’ notions I’d rate
With blood sustained each pure hand... They’d bel.ter part in friendly manner...
With Pelagéya Nikolávna The same’s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
With the berries laughingly, Don’t hear secretly
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
With my request immodest, gladless I’d trouble you for helping me:
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
With one of feet the floor she’s touching, With other slowly she wheels,
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
With time I’d smooth and then might be I’d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
With kin to meet
With dear muse of mine capricious Let’s hear forest’s noise delicious
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
With goat’s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age,
With war; with magazine’s white lie; With snow and with own wife,
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
With Lea, that’s given him too sweety; With ladies’ flatness; tunes of men;
With clear soul
With her he’s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
With Kharlikóv Panfíl and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
With him my cousin first Buyánov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
With dangerous book alone’s hiking, In it reveals she so striking
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
With own wife that’s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry,
With own heavy hall, his dear; Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty,
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
Without fail you’ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torch’s rays;
Without answer.
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
Without them Onegm’s pictured.
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;

- Yes and no yet.
Yes, I shall come, I’ll come!’ - before
Yes, It is he...
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice
Yet does it whirl the world and us:
Yet being child, in children’s throng To play and jump had none desire,
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didn’t play with doll;
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
Yet outside, as well’s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
Yet limpid is the near wood
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
You don’t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,
You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
You’d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
You are in heat.- - But I’m not ill Well... nanny, I’m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!’
You don’t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
You now bless long years’ work
You, Moscow, I thought of you!
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
You poets, are queer!’ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
You’ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:
You now come to rooms, the inner...
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
‘You tell me, prince, if don’t mind,
You’ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
- You tell me, nanny,
You didn’t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?’ -That girl, which’s always so sad;
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
You alone Among anxieties in still
‘You now meet...’ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
‘You see, Tatyana’s not a child,’ The old woman’s voice is mild,-
You’ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
‘You tell of those Your old times... I’ve boring tide..’
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
You help my doubts to resolve:
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
You came two times, but then of self You don’t make them yet reminding
You’ll see: they all become the bosh
You write the odes, gentlemen,
‘You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winter’s mirth you’d had.
You’ll fall in love once more and find… You learn to rule yourself: I fear
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
You see, by skies its predestined:
You give a pen and paper, dear, I’ll stay in bed; make table near;
You get along the Neva’s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!’
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
You listen to my grievous call:
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
You take my set of florid rhymes
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
You must remember that day time,
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,
Zaretsky to behave refuses: ‘But where is the second yours?’
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didn’t want:
Zaretsky cautiously could lay
Zaretsky’s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
Zarétsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
Zhizhi, my soul’s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
Zhookovsky
‘...can’t sleep, it’s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...’

Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
O Russia!
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
Less influence on lady’s head; It was, my friends, Martyn Zadeka,
Eugene’s letter to Tatyana
Was brave instead of ‘elle Nina’ To put the ‘belle Tatiana’
Oh, don’t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
Perhaps, you would agree, that is By marble charms unable Nina
At once was frightened my Tatyana...
‘Pachette!’- Alina!
Is whitening on Lukérya Lvovna, The same yet lies Lytibóv Petróvna.
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
Well, many trifles like the bra.
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
Etcetera.
By hard from big Tambóv’s engaged; Buyhánov whirls with Pustyakóva,
‘What big is Tanya!
‘Ah, Tanya!
Let’s read
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
He was mistaken: sleeping fair — Onegin then for world was dead,
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead?
The shades of night are now rare And Vesper’s met by cock ahead.
One’s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
To get him up she isn’t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
But wretched is, who’s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. — Hut now simply good the head
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
A book at mornings here read...
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didn’t read,
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
They’d better laugh before they had
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Lady’s Fashion Journal had
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
In Tanya’s, Olga’s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
Its time for dinner, Guests have had
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
And old barin room this had;
Thank God, more clearly - she’s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
Let it be so: you have had
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss they’ve had;
Of tyrant you didn’t fear, But now he your fate has had.
But none she had!
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
And she has had
He’s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lensky’s head For sufferings, he here had.
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winter’s mirth you’d had.
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
“Uncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew he’d be glad”.
It’s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
As if by greenish down covered.
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
But you are tortured by the road.
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?’ -That girl, which’s always so sad;
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
Across a glade, all under snow Around which all’s dark and sad.
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
Tell again, You see, I’m now muddle-headed.
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanya’s dear heart indeed.
Let’s listen, yet without labour, To their talking, short indeed.
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
Of elegy’s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
Not madrigals my Lensky’s writing In Olga’s album, and indeed
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
But suddenly her sister’s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
With you I now tears shed;
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
My muse in ethics well embodied!
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
By habits of the life he’s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
Ah, many were by fate denied!
In many trends he’d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
Of enemy from pistol parried.
By many signs she’s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
To have a talk with her he tried
He’s killed!..
Such custom’s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soul’s filled
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he’s killed...’
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
‘Ah, father my! the profit’s worsened..’.
She’s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, she’s often frightened,
Of praised grandfather’s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
In his first youth he was untrained,
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
He’s blessed, who with his love combined
You see, by skies its predestined:
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
‘Of whom your own lyre sighs?’ By you I’m often briskly questioned, -
He’s always frowned, taciturn, He’s chilly, jealous, angry turned!
At last it stopped.
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
All’s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
‘What for you early disappeared?’
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
It now; but ‘Bordeaux’ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
But withered!
But how greatly Tanya’s altered!
Or not for long her heart was shattered
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
He was afraid of being answered
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, he’s admired;
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness who’s admired?
They don’t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
‘And whom your lovely verse adored?’
Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-
Are drying valleys many-coloured;
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!
The ashes patriarchal honoured.
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
Without them Onegm’s pictured.
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed,
Some noise by beetle’s raised.
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
All fashioned model of the creature Who’s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
Buyánov courted: was refused.
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressed».
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
At first his language me confused,
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
Malvina’s works but separated For several roubles he abated,
At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
Or that’s because all my disgrace Would eyes attract to you, belated,
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
But something more us separated...
Appolo’s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poet’s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
The shining skies are now blued.
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
All that I gladlessly survived.
But now doubts all are solved:
Past clans; the charming dreams of love, Antique moralities beloved.
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
My father gave consent to wed.
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
His life’s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
Decayed...
Her role how firmly played,
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
To meet the scholar world’s desire I could describe, you’d be amazed.
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
‘Well, he is killed’,- the neighbour said.
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
And what for is can now lurid?
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
My poor Tanya sits, can’t sleep, And looks into the darkling field.
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
‘You see, Tatyana’s not a child,’ The old woman’s voice is mild,-
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
Sad and cold,
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
Or will he be a lad good natured Like you and I, like all the world?
‘Vladimir Lensky here’s lain, He met his death like man quite hold
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (That’s all he knew in own world...)
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole world…
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
You’ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
To come to tables hand in hand.
More brave than sound man, a grand His message wants to send: weak hand
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
She’s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foe’s hand
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
The tea’s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
His father didn’t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
Hurra! we all have reached the land.
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
Meanwhile his eyes off her can’t tear Some general important, grand.
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
‘Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?’ -All right, my dear, you command.-
Or in the garden hand in hand They walk at morning so grand;
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
Not grasping ways to understand
That uhlan’s loved by all her soul… At altar now does she stand
He’s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
Indeed, for long should have the end!
What’s the end?
I know, you were sent by goodness, You’ll be my guard until the end,
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
They’ve made me marry other man; And I’ll be true to him till end!
She’s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesn’t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
Is not it so, friend?
My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;
With might and main he’ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
With Pelagéya Nikolávna The same’s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you I’m staunch a friend.
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
To me true compass now lend
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
I’ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,
Could my Onegin now find.
Or dismal eye will never find
Such subject’s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.
To hostess a lady’s heading, Some plump grand general’s behind.
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
His soul’s warmed with inspiration By lady’s greetings, friendly kind.
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
Forgotten features can remind.
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
‘You tell me, prince, if don’t mind,
My poor mind...
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
She’s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugene’s kept in mind,
On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind
Is really the secret’s found?
The girls are jumping all around.
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;
The hall is full of crowd; The music’s weary of sound;
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
‘But how did you marry, nanny?’ -It was by wish of God.
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
Last evening frightful words I’d heard; Thank God!
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
Of Moscow young graces good
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
At the games of maidenhood.
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
But now - God! - is cooling blood
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
Each topic’s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
Yet limpid is the near wood
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
Forgive me, isn’t it too hard?’ -For me it’s not - ‘But dear bard,
My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard.
He isn’t more… The youngling bard
It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
She looks, and all her own heart More often’s heating and more hard.
But they would madden it too hard.
Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:
Of years young but whithered hard,
Has found end untimely hard!
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
Bewildered and astonished hard...
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
To loose his colour he’s beginning: She doesn’t see or she’s too hard!?
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
For evening whist who’s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
And exclamations at the board:
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, He’s taking home dreadful hoard,
They say, they’d got For that the best in world reward.
Report for him was so sudden From steward:
’Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
She enters a deserted yard.
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
My dear early little bird!
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
‘Ah, my Lord!’,
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
Of course, he thinks, ‘I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
The enmity’s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
With goat’s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
Around Tanya ladies crowd,
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future won’t be
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
For long has chance with us to be?
With time I’d smooth and then might be I’d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn’t be.
But I… it doesn’t bother me: To old times I’ll loyal be.
Dear! come to rue… As in a dream it seems to be...
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow’s languid peace.
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She’d catch one’s eyes by simple face.
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
What foolish, dumpy is this place!
But then a frenchman took her place.
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It’s poet of grace!’
But well, she’s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister’s pretty grace,
The boy was frisky but with grace.
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden’s choice,
It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice
The colonel sent it for the chance.
Tatyana’s flushing, all she’s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
What joy: to-day we’ll have to dance!
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasn’t smoothed by any chance:
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady’s album if by chance,
But like a house all deserted It’s dark and still, and not by chance
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
Tatyana’s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
Meanwhile her soul’s feelings moan, Her tears filled her languid glance...
My Lensky’s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden’s names by names from France,
None soul’s seen in rooms at entrance...
She’s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
Was asking Olya him at once
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
But soon for husband, all at once,
It’s mute for ever all at once.
Buyánov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
They rush into the yard at once!
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he’s a dunce.
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
Or tenderer - like little moth Which sucks spring flower with force;
He looks al her with tender ardour; He’s yet beloved with previous force,
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
Away from Eugene’s lips; morose, He’s awkward, hardly has he force
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
Boom could fade.
In winter, when the night’s weak shade
All’s blight, all’s white without shade.
But his such sufferable shade,
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
By winter carpets, snow-made.
I can’t foresee any objection To this representation made.
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
Perhaps, in Lethe won’t perish My verse, by wit and heart well made;
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
In man’s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
For husband then she was yet bride.
He’s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
Was talking much of them with pride.
Some real honour and the pride.
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
‘...can’t sleep, it’s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...’
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
‘You tell of those Your old times... I’ve boring tide..’
Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
In tender manner they agree.
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she’s free.
It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
‘D’you think.’ indeed... suspicions any… But do you see...
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
Diana’s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
To fix her fate it’s time, I see;
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
And by the people’s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
‘To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
My cousin dear, Sit down... complex is the life!
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I’ve ruined much of own life.
Who’s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
With war; with magazine’s white lie; With snow and with own wife,
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
‘But who is she?’ She is my wife,
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!’
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
At boring aunt’s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
At such a year, such an age.
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
And great belief in world’s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age,
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
Such time what can you do in village?
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
Of young delirium high rage.
As legends say of old age (For that we’d praise in him the sage).
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
I don’t grudge: why should I grudge?
- Princess, mon ange! -
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
He can’t give happiness at large’.
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
Yes, It is he...
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
Who’s he?
My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesn’t move and doesn’t breathe;
He couldn’t be a bard for ever, He didn’t go mad or die,
In brackets I would like to note: You haven’t more insulting lie,
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you’d like, Or Eden to itself’s unlike.
- D’you joke -
The field is dark in pretty gale...
I’m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
Before arrival; anyhow She isn’t bothered (that’s female!);
The autumn golden is coming, The nature’s now trembling, pale
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
‘But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
It is forgivable.
And give you all that 1 could scribble
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?’
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
Impossible!?
Arid, following Petrarka’s tracks, Could calm his heart’s the biggest trouble.
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
Perhaps I’ll grieve if in a while
Meanwhile
They argue louder; he’s getting Some long a knife; in short a while
We must meanwhile
Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
At Simeon’s he’s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
But after first cordial greeting Zaretsky’s silent for a while
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
Of love mad sufferings she’s feeling . Without ceasing for a while
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
I don’t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
His epigram’s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui i’morir non dole.
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
I don’t mean to please grand people.
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
While he prefered to play a steed. His finger’s frozen a little,
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,
We knew the game of passion’s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
To him she doesn’t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..’
But Tanya’s heart yet isn’t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
Child-Harold’s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
They friends became.
The love’s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
Such men (I’m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
I’m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
And passed away of tears time?
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it’s all the same.
Enough, my friend, its all the same!
‘Well, no, just the same...
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
‘Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
In wonder style To every place he came in time.
My friends, on bard you’d have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
To have a rest and have a hike, That’s why I’ll finish other time.
Is drawn, in turn I’ve bad nay time.
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
All services of old time.
I ask: be patient for a time;
‘Who might be thinking... all the time!
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
Of course, of him I’ll quickly know,- For him I now haven’t time.
Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
For long is weeping she this time.
You must remember that day time,
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
The heart of somebody he’ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadn’t time
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...
To play the cards was used with me.
Forgive me’.
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
Goodness me!
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
It’s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
O’key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me!
Or could be poet with reasons (And I confess - could favour me).
But are you listening yet to me?
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
But road alarm of love then filled me.
Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
She’s after me.
‘But now tell;’ she says, ‘to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?’
With my request immodest, gladless I’d trouble you for helping me:
By nothing bound, I’m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
‘Well... I, my nanny… don’t know... For love I’m longing, dear me!
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
Next day has come...
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:
It was well known friendly wellcome:
It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
«Freischutz» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.
She sees: the room is light again, Through window’s a frosty pane
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
Ideal image, Tanya’s rhyme...
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
In brackets to the point I’d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
‘Here’s He! that’s Eugene!
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
My dashing Eugene?
That time, when in lyceum’s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
I could define
And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine.
‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
Yet outside, as well’s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
And where is her sister line?
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
My memory is dark.., I’m granny... And much forgot... of life the line
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: ‘It’s mine! Its mine’
To me that time you were quite right,’ To you is grateful soul mine...
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
I write it, as for long my time I haven’t any sin of mine.
I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
And what can give me fate of mine?’
Alas, it’s easy to divine!
’He’s ignoramus’, said the neighbours, ’He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
At Verrey’s every morning’s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
Of ‘Clicquot widow’ or ‘Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
You poets, are queer!’ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
‘I don’t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
Well, I remember... has he gone?
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
Unlucky victim, Lensky’s gone...
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar’s gone.
While at the moon Tatyana’s looking, By own heart away she’s gone...
In them he draws the country whole, The Kyprid’s temple, graves alone:
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
More sweet, than joys beneath the moon, Will stay of Torkwat’s octaves tune!
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
From novel’s only beginning — I’ve finished now chapter one.
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
Meanwhile we all. of Hymen foes, In home life yet see but one
-But no one...
Have less in difference between Each one.
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
Pm sure... none, They’ll be the family, the one.
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead you’ll give a hope;
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that’s why at borne
Replace the fortune.
‘I’ll perish, - says my Tanya’s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.
Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
He’s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He’s blessed, who well in time was ripe.
You didn’t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
His Olga’s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
You’ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
The foes put the capes on steppe.
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
Ah, don’t mind’ -My friend, by God to hail I dare —
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare
To keep the happy stirrup dare...
Can’t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
What does next day for me prepare?
‘I see, in world you’ve been too rare...
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
In vain I try to be aware,
And there… -
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can’t adhere
My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here
He thinks of here:
He isn’t here...
Meanwhile they most be not a mock, But honourable..!’ - l could here
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
On leave the gussars hasten here
Like women, books were all left here,
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla’s crowned there.
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
But what severe!
To judgings by the world severe
I’d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,
To ride a horse in steppe severe?
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
The fisher’s fire.
Yet being child, in children’s throng To play and jump had none desire,
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
Italian nights I shall adore.
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
Yes, I shall come, I’ll come!’ - before
She’s running - he is after her; She can’t be running any more,
Much more... -
Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
Or Cleopatra may encore (By others to be heard once more).
Iván Petróvich’s fool and bore, Semyón Petróvich stints yet more;
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
And in the solitude severe Her passion’s heating yet much more,
The shepherd’s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
The tears of the people’s awe. Katenin there could restore
Malfilatre.
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards they’ll not endure
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we can’t endure,
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
It’s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
And she, that young and lovely creature;
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
Expresses death but not the torture.
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!’
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
Mazurka is the crowd’s choice; All round are crush and noise;
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
He’s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
What purpose?
My age inclines for strict a prose, Against light rhymes my age arose
In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what d’you think? again collapse!’
The morning pleasant noise arose.
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
He’ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
He can’t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
I live and write not for applause,
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
To Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuse
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soul’s rate
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
He doesn’t gather them with horn. A maiden’s singing in her house,
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty’s letter I should use.
What’s use?
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
And with Onegin’s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
But my fate
Indeed, d’you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
I can’t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.
In life with us like new it’s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
At Kharitónya’s in the alley In front of house at the gate
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
It’s late.
I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,
I have without any doubts Tatyana’s letter to translate.
Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,
With love friends’ notions I’d rate
‘Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
As pawn that’s worth of dear mate.
Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
Upstairs to the highest rate.
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
The capital’s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I’d like to write,
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
Be glad with such a man… You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
And unattentive smart lornette.
Alas, Tatyana’s daily fading: She’s paling, sinking and is mute,
Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.
She courted… at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter’s trembling on her palm, The wafer’s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
By new one can’t I be admired I pity old one - it’s true.
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heaven’s blue
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
And that... but afterwards you’ll know, Is not it true?
‘Indeed? - my Eugene’s now thinking, - But is it true?..
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
Marmontel’s volume them he gave.
On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame You’d guess, as I would well behave
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
And much the more it’s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
He’s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
My dear God, you bless and save!
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
What for to grieve?
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
A mere hit from all I’d give.
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
Do comme il faut… (Shishkov, forgive; can’t some good translation give).
Forgive!
Arid thus we now part, forgive!
My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!
A brave sledge-cart from field’s returning, It’s fluffy furrows upturning,
And wondered: would he be alive?’
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
Which’s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
For what and where do I strive?
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
On earth, then might be by her love She’d joined the friends the day above!
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
You help my doubts to resolve:
But can’t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
Of humble girl some secret love?
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
Or otherwise I’d be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-
Or on the lyre draws a dove With pens and paints, with all his love;
My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, I’m husband yours by love!"
If you could know, what’s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,
Of poet, who’s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
But whom to love?
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
Ah, he could love; they don’t now Have anything like real love
Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
And I’ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
His misty, foggy gaze
I dread: in my submissive prayers You’ll see by strict, severe gaze
His ardent talk was full of haze;
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul’s haze.
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendship’s heavy haze?
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
Like Harold Child Onegin’s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
Zarétsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
And nothing cooled his strong belief:
To comfort sorrow and grief.
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
And you, ‘Bordeaux’ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
Alone with his soul’s self Unsatisfied was by himself.
And quickly both they yet off
Whose author bolter nature’s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
Onegin’s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
And then he dressed himself...
To write about otherself As if about ownself?
Who’s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
Let’s visit them; you’ll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself:
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
But he’s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
If she’s seeing
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
My bad translation incomplete. Its like of picture poor copy; Or like of
‘But who? plump general that big?’
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maiden’s album big,
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
Who left Tambóv without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
It’s both harmful and absorbing.
Sincerely, in grief embracing
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again he’s dancing.
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end life’s novel reading,
At first of them she didn’t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
Alone’s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isn’t fading,
The fire-place is fading...
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
At fire-place the table’s lain: Onegin’s waiting - Lensky’s speeding
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
Imagine: I’m alone, thus From no man have understanding...
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
He trembles... to princess he’s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
You came two times, but then of self You don’t make them yet reminding
What roses, you can be judging,
Or with the nature just reviving We close in, confused by minding
Mazurka’s sounding.
He didn’t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children you’d be seeing
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isn’t seeing;
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
To protests of soul’s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend I’m now singing,
Just He! His gaze on her he’s fixing, Like dreadful shade for her he’s reaching,
This way my Eugene was her teaching.
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
He looks, he calls him - all’s for nothing!
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
In horror Tanya is awaking...
A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
For how long?
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goethe’s, Shiner’s places hiking,
The clock’s been striking
With dangerous book alone’s hiking, In it reveals she so striking
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
Tatyana’s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
That was the way of Eugene’s thinking.
In fear shameful heart is sinking.
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
And who, d’you think, from it is looking?
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields she’s now looking:
But then with books she could be dealing.
‘Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, I’m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Onegin’ -Well done dealing.
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hare’s trembling
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this world’s fuss she’s hatred feeling.
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
Onegin’s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
Surprises deeply all his reeling?
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
Onegin’s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
- All they are yet feeling
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
I’ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you I’m dangling:
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
To Lensky he could listen smiling.
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on table’s falling
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
In fear I was crying, darling,
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
About what she’s now dreaming?
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughter’s bed till day was dreaming
That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
His nets for them were so frightening!
Too long the silence’s now seeming...
The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
They laugh; the guests are now coming.
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
What languid is her gaze guile charming:
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
To make your dear magic tuning Of beauty’s passion mood, resuming
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
Or where Thalia’s stilly dreaming To friendly claps yet isn’t listening;
That recently I was you christening?’
You don’t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
He shouts: ‘Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
I love you (why should I be cunning?).
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
All barking, dogs to her are running.
Meanwhile the moon was brightly shining, By languid light it was enlightning
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
And what’s Onegin doing?
D’you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?’
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence now’s keeping.
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while he’s sleeping,
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful she’s shyly stepping
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasn’t grasping.
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
For fair of the brides her bring,
They say, you are a lone guy, In country’s stillness you are boring.
I…’ -But you are boring
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
An Lane’s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
He hurries up to ring.
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I can’t be appraising,
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
Nor makes get up without choosing.
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
Let’s turn the route we now here To keep in mind of whom I sing...
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
But Hymen’s troubles, griefs of mating,
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
What was the sequence of the meeting?
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
By clear smile the nature’s fitting Through dream the year’s morning meeting
Invitations for a meeting?
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Ran up and not without fighting
At last she’s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
For his delight were just awaiting.
Khandra pursued him, always waiting,
Already for triumph he’s waiting,
And by the salt of worlds backbiting
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
A passionate epistle’s writing.
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
That’s why in French she’s always writing.
I prize my hours, my days: But I’m in idle boredom wasting
And then at prince she was adjusting
Whom you’d be trusting?
I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But let’s return to lady sitting.
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
‘And I was gingebread you giving!’
Regards of them to you I’m giving.
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living,
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
All yet living
And now North, all clouds driving,
Of mind some vague a thought is moving...
The snow-drift at once is moving...
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtain’s moving
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
I write, and heart yet isn’t boring, The pen unwitting isn’t drawing
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
She all is trembling, paling, shying.
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
A lady’s love until to-day To speak her Russian isn’t trying,
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
To guess the windy youth is trying
‘There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!’
Maiden’s Song
The evening darkness comes along...
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
Of men, whom I can’t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
For flying glory don’t long.
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
The master’s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
Or really she guessed not wrong?
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
Or where Terpsichore one Amazes all the public young
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
Each minute more is captivated By Olga’s beauty so young,
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
‘Ah, Eugene!’, - She is quickly running, Like shade she’s prompt, to exit’s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back it’s hard; In short a minute she’s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
It’s striking ten; he’s driving out. He’s flying... now he’s at porch.
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
In hands I have Tatyana’s letter. It’s kept by me with sacred sigh.
At neighbour’s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
But Latin’s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
Could me enjoy... I’ve had my fill; It is enough!
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
The coachman’s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
Who carefully us can cherish?
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
Who helps from slander not to perish?
As object of the judging noisy, In life you’d never have a wish:
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
You’ll see: they all become the bosh
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she can’t have breath..
Or on the leaves for recollections, Of other signatures beneath
He’s trembling, loses fitting words, He’s happy, has improved his health,
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
And so grew they old both.
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth,
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, We’ll call him dandy for the forth.
In own dreams all’s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
Alone to my nurse, who’s being My old friend from youth and forth.
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?
Let me look back.
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
Her face but has of wrath a track...
Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistol’s cock.
The pistols all are now shining, The hammer’s jingling at the lock,
Meanwhile with cold sham to dare To force the speech and look with mock
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madman’s hearty mock.
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olga’s frock.
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
My Eugene’s standing As if by thunder has been struck,
‘But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
To walk?
Her husband’s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novel’s crank.
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
Of multiplied his own crank.
Or, as before, he plays the crank?
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
His morbid and quite dying look,
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
She doesn’t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
‘Left side?.. but where? what is there?’ I ‘It doesn’t matter, but you look,
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
The hamlet, where Eugene’s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
As at the reason of the parting Tatyana’s grumbling at the brook,
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for river’s crook.
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
The evening sky’s more dark.
Its dark.
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shiller’s work.
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
You now bless long years’ work
But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
Its time! - I everyday appeal.
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
Well have the music regimental!
He came, What news, such sentimental!
Meanwhile small foot in hands l feel;
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
Sometimes she’s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola I’ll travel
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!
By night’s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
While she’s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
He doesn’t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
Like victim under charming veil.
About Lensky’s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
But suddenly was changed it all:
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn’t talk at all,
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
At the beginning of my novel — (In chapter first you look it all)
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
For theatre Onegin’s speeding. In it each man is free at all:
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
The first he made - he left you all;
To tell you all, what he had known, I haven’t any time at all.
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winter’s bliss and tinges all:
But send your boy, and first of all’ .
But you are pale... What are you feeling? ‘It’s nothing, nanny, not at all.
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasn’t right at all
Healthy all...
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
I’d like to use the Alban’s model: In Petersburg to show ball.
It’s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journal’s call:
You listen to my grievous call:
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at river’s banks they fall.
My Tanya’s hugged by their daughters.
It’s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
Importantly repeats for doll The mother’s lessons, though small.
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horses’ stall…’
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
Is flying from the waxy cell.
I’m sorry that you go… well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
Behind the mill.
A bee to fields, of tribute well,
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
Much longer now she is hiking, But now brook and now hill
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
The sledge for race is now ready, In it he’s flying to the mill;
It all is still.
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the country’s still!
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forest’s still
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, she’s standing still.
The waters Are still.
You alone Among anxieties in still
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
As I to loose my freedom feared Which’s hateful to my own will.
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didn’t play with doll;
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pull…
‘But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?’
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
With clear soul
Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,
On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
Opinion of the public mournful!
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
To you I’m greatful!
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful,
‘Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
Its worth of fine and charming soul,
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
The doubts all confused her soul:
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
A bowl
That’s what I am.
May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream
But Tanya now like in dream
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soul’s quiet dream.
And slowly through fields she’s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
And where everything’s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
I saw myself in cherished dream
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Neva’s stream,
But now radiant moon’s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
I — It sparkles by Hippocrene’s role, It was by own play and foam
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
With reason I remembered them.
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
Or when a worm disdained and deadly Is growing out lily’s stem
Princess is staring at him...
Princess, undone yet before him
Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didn’t come at all to him
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
My God! what thoughts could come to him!’
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
Alter him
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!’
Three houses will wait for him.
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
Through tears never seeing him,
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
From bed Onegin wasn’t moving, The dream yet flies about him.
He’s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
As sign of friendship’s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, he’s being in a whim.
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
What’s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
What a whim...
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet she’s looking rather slim;
On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:
Rousseau (I’d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
The Gulnare’s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
The snow’s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
A hundred times is blessed, who’s faithful. Who’s got his wit to be quite calm,
In country’s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
But will it come, my day of freedom?
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
The same I was in time of wisdom,
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
Possesses half of world existing Much longer, in the softened loom
Or can he see forgotten foes, Some cravens, slanderers, a swarm
Reminiscence of old time, Of maiden’s room!
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfast’s ready in the room.
And here is the banns room.
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
Who never bores us by his charm?
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
And I’m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
To whom my vice is not a harm?
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
Lord Byron with his whim successful Enveloped fussy egoism In hopeless romanticism.
Forgive, secluded my asylum!
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
As quick as can
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
Of bold children’s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
-it’s right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;
In them I’ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
Is spoiled by old duels fan, He’s evil, gossip, talking man...
On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
A simple maiden
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
Enough... and has been done the burden:
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
Where we have never been.
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
What for yet here has he been?
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
Well, I saluted classicism! It’s late, but preface has been seen.
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?
My Vanny Was younger, than myself I mean, And I was, dear, yet thirteen.
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
To them He paid his all attention then.
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
- Not, then!
The head of Chaldean wise men, — Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
Or Baratinsky with his pen,- Let be you birnt by thunder then!
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
‘Whith Olga what could happen?
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
Ah, many friends were near then!
Has fallen…
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
You write the odes, gentlemen,
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
With Lea, that’s given him too sweety; With ladies’ flatness; tunes of men;
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
And whispered her each one of them: ‘You look left side at those men…’
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
Unwittingly in mirror’s peeping Ashamed to recognize: he’s beaten;
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
-Let’s go.- They were quietly driven,
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet she’s sighing once again
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
By Olga’s hand the tea’s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyana’s standing, She’s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted window’s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
Or village house - at the pane Is sitting she.., and she again!,.
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
I dread to read again...
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquet’s cracks wee heard again.
In letters though he again
Unmoving, lone he’s again.
Alas! I must repeat again:
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
Because she’s innocent and plain,
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
Have been decayed in nature’s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
It in strain
A menu hangs for order’s sake And teases appetite in vain.
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
At brook the monument is seeing She’s drawing made of leather rein,
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
Onegin.
Tatyana’s letter to Onegin.
What’s my Onegin?
And then I thought: He’s now in;
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
Came in.
His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
Presents his friend and distant kin.
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
He’s now languished by remorse, He’s being ready to beg pardon,
What is your name? - He’s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphon…
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
He didn’t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
Onegin’s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
I can foresee: you’ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
My Moscow... in this lunation
For you the glory and the laud, The father’s land, incarceration?
To touch in splendid admiration.
Where’s agitation And honourable aspiration
Great charm to any conversation.
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
For thoughtful singing with attention?’
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
At first they’d nothing seen In common.
Go on!
Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun he’s looking on...
Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning, His bolivar he’s having on	{3]
Like in van Dick’s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, she’s boon
Like thoughts of simple lady’s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
If their district visits on?
Byron
If by the family best vision For instant I’d be charmed with reason,-
And what’s the reason?
That instant I could trunk with reason
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
But hero, I’m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
Or kind of madcap; sad a version Of some Satanic ugly person,
Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!’
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
He, might be, for the world’s welfare Or even for the fame was born;
On table’s hissing yet, forlorn...
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
And is it true, it can’t return?
‘Shall go forth or should return?..
I’ll take a look and then turn’,
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
And am I soon at thirties turn?
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
And didn’t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
By bondage Lensky’s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirror’s aiming down,
Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
For centures to make him known.
I’m unknown...
And I’m in family unknown...
I was his friend some while ago.
She doesn’t say: ‘Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
Did try to make of that some fun: The country’s freedom has its own
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Onegin’s eyes make tire own,
All right, by hand unfair own
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
‘No’.
But it is late, it’s time to go...
On steps of world the bard might go
Or, like in fever, can he get A touch of hand, or helps to go
Andryushka, quicker must you go!
Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
To be with you I cannot go...
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
Annette; And on the last one you read so:
With him my cousin first Buyánov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
In them you can’t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
He’s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
My poets! I’d like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear
She runs for forest... he’s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
A need for sleep.
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
Not a word can slip
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
She doesn’t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isn’t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
I stop!
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
All that I don’t grasp.
He’s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
is going, and when she’s trying To turn aside... is coming up
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
I’ve read it up:
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
At usual hour stirred up, In candle’s light she’s getting up.
To other things let’s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runs… the bear’s after her!
But dangerous for the maiden’s heart) Quite reddenning he’s missing up.
But other times in mind I bear!
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
Enough, my dear...
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
I didn’t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
He’s not been seen, none word from dear;
And Olga’s yawning; round here She’s looking for her Lensky dear.
In early spring of every year.
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!’… -To whom, my dear?
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
But then your horse will try in fear
Goodness me, it isn’t For him to hear!
That he’s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
You’ll fall in love once more and find… You learn to rule yourself: I fear
All flows in a single gear...
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
All’s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
Shall I again your chorus hear?
He slept and coffee had he here, His menager’s reports could hear,
-Just solemn odes you could hear!
D’you hear?
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshky’s sounds hear),
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
‘And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
You give a pen and paper, dear, I’ll stay in bed; make table near;
Tanya, near!
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
D’you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
‘But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
It’s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
Like Julie’s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
And when a falling shining star
-What said the satirist, remember!
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesn’t slumber,
The same is dog, the same’s her man Which is of club the loyal number,
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
‘I’ll be defender; I’ll not endure when offender
And you forgive, my freedom later!
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
Is cunning liric, who can render
His look was always quick and tender,
Such charming, tender.
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
She’s not astonished, hasn’t anger...
What blunder! I’m a punished ranger.
But it’s enough to speak of her:
Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:
‘Of them my Olga is the younger.
To answer her.
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
‘Lord! to her!..
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
And when sometimes in front of her
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
The wish of heart to whisper her.
‘Tanya though!’ ‘D’you know her?-
For tears, rhymes and so on?… Present me her’.
And. told her:
What shall I do, I can’t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
It’s time, its time to marry her!
Tatyana hadn’t any trends To play with them in any weather:
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
‘What slow-witted you are, nyanya!’ -I’m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barin’s will I’d rather…-
Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
‘But I’d prefer another,
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian “н” in French best manner
Some other...
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
With blood sustained each pure hand... They’d bel.ter part in friendly manner...
Where is it better?
You now come to rooms, the inner...
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
All have the supper.
Well dressed, she’s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
Every country eater
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
You are in heat.- - But I’m not ill Well... nanny, I’m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
But let me help with sacred water.
My God, a scene from novels dear...’ -And that’s my daughter...
With her he’s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
It’s winter!..
‘Well, dear me, what is the matter?
It’s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,
All they utter
Prepare ruins once for ever...
My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever.
If not... if not, let God deliver!
Her tender fingers didn’t dare To take a needle; she could never
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
The day had gone, but no answer...
Without answer.
But no answer...
She’s up at once, Like shade she’s pale, but no answer...
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
But She whom I yet don’t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
Onegin’s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
Onegin’s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
Hor
Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;
He opened a door."
Monsieur Triquet is on the floor, In jersey, capped, not far from door.
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
My disillusioned lornette, Of joy some careless spectator,
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journal’s clamour
- To pour half-glass you do a favour...
Let’s go, do thorn such a favour!
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
At sister Tanya isn’t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girl’s small feet and no heads.
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
To all these letters, tears, deeds...
But where now through them speeds
Four fatal for the life the stages...
But she’s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
Some loss in all the song’s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
Its here: take it and be ‘tackling’ !) All look like silver snowy fields...
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
She’s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
She’s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
‘And I your ears pulled by hands!’
I was taking you in hands!
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
Polite; with sharp-clawed paw he’s rapping Her hand to offer help; she bends
She’s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanya’s shoulder he bends;
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Who isn’t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
I had happened To know many old legends,
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
All poets, meanwhile I’ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
The heaven’s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
Among admirers obedient I’ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
Who father’s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
He’ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
Let give the God his soul chances
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
But that’s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
At goose’s neck a skull is fateful, It’s whirling round for all sides;
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
But now, friends, from all my sides -
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
The prince as if anew him sees:
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
Of higher world the queer ladies!
From glass not stopping For a while’. He never kisses hands of ladies,
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
The snow’s crackling... someone’s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
Of yard boys family just flies.
Maliciously discuss with smiles: If I was sharp or dull in lies,
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
At her much frightened loud cries
A shepherd bast gay sandal’s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his mother’s finger shakes.
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once one’s feelings strikes.
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
With age to argue is unfitness; The custom’s despot of the males.
Meanwhile some two or three of pages (Some idle gibberish or fables,
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
-In this I see yet no troubles…
Of daily troubles.
Is it because in higher circles
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
Ali that has gone like sound’s fizz, And dear Tanya’s youth all dwindles:
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
Tatyana trusted legend’s fancies Of simple folk’s old times.
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
Slipshod result of my pastimes,
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
‘Bordeaux’ all the times!
I know: Parny’s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
Her husband comes.
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: ‘Ah!’ But he becomes
You take my set of florid rhymes
Onegin’s coining with excuses.
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
At other kinds of lines.
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
The foes!
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
Why not? It’s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
He cast a glance at ladies’ tires, At circles but with looks, attires
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
‘But trouble is: they are such bores’.
But can’t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades’ spectres
She doesn’t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
Do not reflect Diana’s features, Recalling bygone novel’s creatures,
His pistol then Onegin raises
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;
La morale est dans 					la natura des choses.
Indeed, by magnetism’s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
Zhizhi, my soul’s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
The vice, that’s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
Philosopher among his mates With them his room he decorates.
(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
Some foreign words, she often writes.
Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
The first of leaflets just can show: Qu’ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
Or aren’t we glad to see returning Of perished in the autumn leaves
But shall I see you?’ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,
Monotonous and sometimes yet senseless, Like whirlwind of the youthful lives,
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
Alas! On furrows of lives
Some several miles from Krasnogóry, From Lensky’s village, there lives
I’d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.
Or am I stranger to enjoyments, To all that gladdens and revives,
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kant’s ideas and his moves.
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
Of course, Onegin’s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
Grand treaty’s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
But in gloomy cliffs
She’s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
Of known ladies feet and legs.
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
To take it up she can’t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novel’s beings,
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
To Moscow, they need good things.’..,
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine I’ve shooting things.
Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things.
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
Of agitated soul’s feelings
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
She falls on snow - he is swifty: He’s taking her in paws and brings,
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles brings’
Onegin got Tatyana’s message. It quickly touched his soul’s strings:
My greetings!
That dream aroused her misgivings.
The talkative my lyre’s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
He’s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
By got by Olga strange tuition She’s touched, in depth of soul sighs;
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
Decided is.
Which doesn’t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
Who’s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?’,
Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
It shows traceries affective, Informs of mind’s the secret backs.
In all of them restriction’s queer; Antiquity the old backs.
The novelty with ages smacks.
But by your narrow small tracks,
Of tears tracks?..
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forest’s thicks?
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricks…
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
May be, you saw at Neva’s banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
Some tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,’ to thinks
She thinks:
Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
In sledge he’s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
His own works?
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
Zaretsky’s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
My muse new person just reveals.
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels
With one of feet the floor she’s touching, With other slowly she wheels,
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
And boring pictures’ row, done In style of La Fontaine’s sweet novels.
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What’s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.
Of legislator of the halls?
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga Petushkóv then whirls,
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maiden’s dreams.
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
That time to all my childish dreams
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
Indeed, he’s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
At window alone, sad (Diana’s ray lights up, her wakens)
‘Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
At margins of the books she’s meeting Of reader’s pencil slightest signs:
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each other’s brains;
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
To have remorse I haven’t forces; Like Bogdanovich’s all verses I’d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
In young sad soul’s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
We’ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
Of mind some cold observations,
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
He hasn’t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
The folly’s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
And he inspired her at dawns!
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armid’s pretty lips,
It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
Each claps.
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
Mazurka now all its rating, Initiative beauties keeps:
Her maiden’s mirror yet she keeps.
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
Rather well The grove sleeps.
Tatyana steeps.
Of looking back she doesn’t dare And hurries up, she’s quickening steps,
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
Or Idol mio; dropped by chance On fire journals or his pumps.
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
‘Well, let us go…’ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
This news Tatyana quickly hears.
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyana’s husband just appears,
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
Love-letter secrets on six sheets, The fraud, the gossip, rings, the tears,
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
In crowd everybody renders:
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
‘To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?’
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
Brothers!
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
At any sides we’ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
Like North Aurora’s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
Zaretsky to behave refuses: ‘But where is the second yours?’
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
Says yes or no, never да-с Or нет-с’(the words, they all would pass).
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
She doesn’t glare at the rest, And doesn’t claim to have success;
Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!
To meet princess.
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but don’t we. confess.
Was too afraid, I must confess...
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
‘For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
Like Byron, poet of grace. Or it’s impossible or faithless
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
In village, in forgotten stillness Of you I’d never know, thus I wouldn’t know tortures sleepless.
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
‘And whom?’ - She’s Larin’s. -
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
With age the life is such a badness...’
In actions husband’s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
I like teenage’s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaid’s.
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret torment’s gladness...
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
‘Sed alia temporal’ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
His lunch him answered with politeness.
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
‘I’m not quite made to be much happy. My soul’s alien for bliss;
Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
He liked the grove’s timid thickness,
But you forgive him, games in stillness!
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But it’s a stress
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizon’s foolish brightness’.
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
And no brow moved she rasher; She didn’t even lips her press.
But with Tatyana shan’t we guess.
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
Perfections yours make speech my gappy, Of them I’m not yet worthy, miss.
In duels classic, pedant cross
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maiden’s.
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
But doesn’t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
At window she now sits.
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
Of words for songs of prairie districts...
At rocks of the Caucasian districts
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
In country tedium’s prevailing Without palaces or streets,
Why! out of the country thickets...’
In deserts of the heaven’s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
By sorcery of story’s secrets!
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
But where are you? Come! My rights
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
I’m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
Apostate of wild enjoyments,
By him were left at your employments.
Whom don’t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladies’ hearts.
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
Meanwhile Onegin’s stay at Larin’s Was estimated like a news,
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
But landlords of the country’s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
And he invents by whim’s requests Caricatures of the guests.
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
With dear muse of mine capricious Let’s hear forest’s noise delicious
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests it’s always zealous,
Perhaps, in front of portrait famous, To people future ignoramous
Alone you, to speak my mind, I’d take as friend of days my grievous,
And Tatyana’s nervous
We them remind about us...
O , rus!
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
And let them God long live for us!
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
Yet does it whirl the world and us:
What for you visited all us?
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier she’s liking us,
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
-I’m glad. - ‘but when?’ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
His verse is sluggish and obscure (It’s called romanticism by us;
Shall see emotional flight?
But even such a friendship, readers, We haven’t now; each of us
The seasons country views
To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
Some cold wind just blows.
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
’But may be she’s in love?’ ‘Who knows?
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
You’ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
‘At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: ‘I’ve my happy days...’
Will take the twilight of my days.
Lornette his double slantwise renders To see all ladies to be fit,
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
Who’s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
Without fail you’ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torch’s rays;
Who’s that, which never us betrays?
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself I’ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
The woman says:
Can’t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
The withering of own days, Which can’t revive by any ways?
A dwarf with tail; and there’s that Who’s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
It’s dark in valleys.
Petrarka 			Where days are cloudy and short 			A tribe was there born 			For which to die makes no hurt. (It.)
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drums’s beat.
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
He stepped away... he turned a bit..’-
What?
Of dear friends a pretty chat.
But why? I don’t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
THE END
She hurries up to have a chat.
In dark my Tanya’s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
For all of that
Then he for her a chair’s finding, They speak about this and that,
As they are mean and simple features, You won’t see fine art in that.
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
And what?
And what?
‘But do you love, indeed, the other?’ -And what? -
And what.
And what?
And what? -
She’s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
But never wanted to correct; To censorship I’ll pay my debt;
But may be those kinds of pictures By now can’t you all attract,
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
His letter’s here, quite exact.
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
He differed people in effect, And other’s passions could respect.
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
But I can hardly drag my feet,
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
For garden now we shall fleet In which she’s got with him to meet.
With kin to meet
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
But many days away could get
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
Of own life he could forget!
Made all young heart to pine away, For someone did her soul wait.
‘I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
Of stylish words some ready set?
‘You now meet...’ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
- Yes and no yet.
Is he a parody not yet?
But summer’s flying quicker yet.
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift
Because ire, truthfulness she’s swift? Because from heavens got as gift
Should I begin my freedom flight.
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinter’s crackling making light.
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
I was embittered, he… unfit.
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heaven’s bodies light
Meanwhile the Cyclops of the village In front of dimmish forge’s light
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
And fair sex like down’s slight...
Opinions of the worldly might...
And often at Taurida’s beaches She brought me in the have of night
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
Of ballet’s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
In languish of the loving bounds He’s spending now day and night.
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
It’s right.
And often in the summer’s sphere, When clear is the sky at night
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
They don’t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasn’t right.
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
I don’t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
It’s time to leave for life the tight
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, who’s lost in thought,
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
For her he’s looking on... for nought...
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
They all replaced for each of roberts; The tea’s been brought.
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
’My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait.
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
‘It’s seven soon, it’s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to wait’.
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
‘My habit,..
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
And proud language’s now lit For prose postal a bit.
‘My dreams and years won’t rather Return to make me new a bit,
It’s better place for passing letters fit.
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
In front of him gay fancy’s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
The letter’s ready, has been fit...
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, You’ll never leave me such unfit.
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
Istómina’s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
Meanwhile in life you try to revel, As much as I you take form it!
Onegin’s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
-But what is it -
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
My student’s cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit,
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
A yard boy’s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
Together for a time they sit.
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
With Kharlikóv Panfíl and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
And by degrees to sleep he’s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l don’t want;
What happened, what a strange a dreamt
And now jealouser’s triumphant!
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didn’t want
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didn’t want:
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages don’t want.
What more you want?
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
By dreadful exclamation Onegin’s shuddered; slain, impatient
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
Are silent.
What will he choose for his engagement?
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
Most be respected for the life. And true girl-friend in love’s adjustment
Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
The inns are absent.
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didn’t join the guild existent
Haphazard wander to prevent.
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larin’s soon forever went:
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
They joked, not without sin At Tanya’s suitor made a hint.
And stands at stint
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation’s lint, -
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyana’s heart was burnt!
Not...
But uncoordinated volumes From devil’s library all got,
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
Lornette his captious he has got,
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
The mistress cries, ‘At last you’ve got!’
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
Is it high time as I forgot
‘And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.’.
The youthful years would be fading, The soul’s heat would not be hot
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young lover’s lot:
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
It might he other: he’d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
Is it not
And… he could not.
‘Do not.’
They didn’t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
She’s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldn’t give a hoot..
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,
It’s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
Became alredy quite inapt.
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tama’s heart.
For nowhere am I smart...
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
About other’s restless passions, And other’s love will touch the heart, -
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
But to no person In all the world I’d give my heart,
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
Indeed, you won’t With all your pure flaming heart
Of grievous notes of the heart.
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
It’s all decided (it’s my version) By heavens board: I’m yours at heart.
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
With which to start?
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..’
In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
But at least
May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
Of what a languor’s full her breast?
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
In talks all’s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
I haven’t force... is tired breast…
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
And how long?’ ‘Two will he fast...’
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!’
‘It’s mine!’ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
He’s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
With own wife that’s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
And stilly does she say at last:
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
The spring of honour, idol last!
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
To scratch unfaithful icy path As he’s afraid to fall at last.
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
To inner porch he goes fast, He’s laying down her at last.
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
I liked his features in the past:
Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures won’t be the best.
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
‘My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
For love she’s dedicated truly Like loyal child for mother’s nest,
The ‘else’s trends’, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere, To give the boy some chance to rest,
New way I’m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.
With heavenly her pride she’s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
We haven’t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
Let’s come together... take a rest...
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid let’s have dinner before rest!
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.
The beds are made. And any guest
But hist!
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
Not Eugene he’s at most?
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isn’t frozen by frost.
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
‘I’m neighbour just’.
‘Enough, get up, I now must
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
The fire’s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coal’s crust;
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being The heir of all relatives in trust.
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I can’t...
Deserted room alone filling You read; it’s Pradt, it’s Walter Scott.
But yet she can’t.
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
-But what about?
In book’s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
Again promiscuosly he’s reading… Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
To you I’ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
If I were poet like you.
You, Moscow, I thought of you!
But what I’d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
Or vagrant Melmoth, such distressful, Or Corsair, or Eternal Jew,
Meantime account, made for you, In details I shall give to you,
‘For single winter it will do, At least I’ll credit money you’…
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
Believe, I’d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarka’s language ‘I love you’ .
From two to thirty years on; The district dandy Petushkóv,
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, I’d like with you
In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used I’d run from you;
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0
Dmitriyev.
Griboyedov
(Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired Flyánov,
With own heavy hall, his dear; Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv
It’s signed by t.a.v.
All’s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy Pustyakóv
I love him, he’s my kin in-law.
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
Lensky saw
Of life her features have but few.
Or Sbogar, mythical a few.
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
And me you have in view...
What for would ever view
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
Among the friends the moon’s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
I’ve heard some voice of new desire, I’ve got new sorrow anew;
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
Effects, but stepped away anew; He’s blessed much more, who never knew
And with a bow
How would you not love Moscow?
To-morrow we’ll Tanya show...
For changes fated anyhow...
She’s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
What kind’s he now anyhow?
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
Of lively lucid verse’s glow,
‘What, you are married! didn’t know!
D’you know?...
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
Is he the same or quiet now?
I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
But now...
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,
You’d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
Two pistols in a row,
This kind of book yet doesn’t show The writer’s fancies in a row,
Tatyana’s interest is affected By melting on the fire wax:
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
She’s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,
When he’s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
And in a day
And gradually rises day.
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
‘Me?’ - Yes, Tatyana’s name-day happy Will be on Saturday...
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
On river’s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
She’s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
The further I’m from youth my gay,
And drifting of the country’s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
Zaretsky cautiously could lay
‘I fell in love’, again she whispers In nurse’s ear in dismay.
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
And. so cunny, she is gay. Already’s able to betray!
What do you want to ask, you say!
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
She’s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
Her tired look and slipped away...
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
She went away.
Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?
I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
‘I fell in love... you’d get away
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;
Her head to shoulder’s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
And all grandparents exclaim: ’But how years fly away!’
Or may be guessed from far away That uncle his would pass away.
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
And she, as if she’s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
To call some people gets away.
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
‘What’s happened?’- `Nothing’… - Gets away.
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winter’s even every way.
Then we’ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
At him she stares all the way:
‘What way?
Moldavia, that’s far away From Italy, was end of way.
From mountains descends this way
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by
You get along the Neva’s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.
To cry, to weep I’m now ready...’ -I see, you are unwell already
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,
I see you strong already!
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse already’s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, it’s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!
Onegin’s quick to dress. Already His sernant’s ordered to be ready
I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready
Has come; to servant says he will Lepage’s fatal barrels steady
Ah! I’ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:
«It’s time to change them in a body,
Let us play inventfully, Lot us play more happily,
The way to keep her man away! And everything became o’key.
H’m, h’m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk o’key?
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify
All’s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I don’t know why.
The novel’s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Perhaps,’ says Lensky.
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
On jade postillion’s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beard’s shaggy.
More pretty than a parquette fashioned, The river, clad in ice, is flashy,
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.
On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snow’s filthy
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesn’t know why)
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why
K. Vyasemsky.
Baratynsky.
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;
Zhookovsky
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky
Meanwhile far off The honest person and Zaretsky
Maiden’s singing intimate, Don’t peep invisibly
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;
Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly
When in the garden’s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly
What does the kinsfolk mean namely?
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.
-To Larin’s -’Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings daily…
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...
Let’s away get rapidly, Him bespatter easily
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With Göttingen in soul frankly,
Explain to you, do it frankly.
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;
But really?
Or, like coquette, he simply boomed? By his good will Or willy-nilly
It means the following thing mainly:
Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply -
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.
Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
Exactly...
With the berries laughingly, Don’t hear secretly
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:
Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintly’.
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?
‘You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!’
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,
‘To me you wrote, Do not deny.
- You tell me, nanny,
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,
She’s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,
Or even own demon mine. Onegin (him I’ll occupy),
He’s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry
And can’t; she’s now deeply worrier!, She moans and she’d like to cry...
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldn’t cry,
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;
You don’t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,

We sing of their lucky fate And glory!
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story
But forward, forward, you, my story!

Well, to present you I shall try’

Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.

Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: He’s blessed, who knew all their pretty
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashion’s duty,
‘Agreed’ - You... dear guy!
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.











---------------------------------------------------------------------------------










I don’t mean to please grand people.
With love friends’ notions I’d rate
And give you all that 1 could scribble
As pawn that’s worth of dear mate.
Its worth of fine and charming soul,
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
Of lively lucid verse’s glow,
Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
All right, by hand unfair own
You take my set of florid rhymes
Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
Slipshod result of my pastimes,
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
Of years young but whithered hard,
Of mind some cold observations,
Of grievous notes of the heart.
CHAPTER ONE
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
K. Vyasemsky.
I
‘My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!’
II
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being The heir of all relatives in trust.
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
III
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
But then a frenchman took her place.
The boy was frisky but with grace.
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere, To give the boy some chance to rest,
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
IV
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
Onegin’s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
What more you want?
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.
V
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
His epigram’s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
VI
But Latin’s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,
Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaid’s.
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply -
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
VII
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
His father didn’t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
YIII
To tell you all, what he had known, I haven’t any time at all.
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
Moldavia, that’s far away From Italy, was end of way.
IX
………………….. 	………………….. 	…………………..
X
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
For all of that
Of own life he could forget!
His look was always quick and tender,
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
XI
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
XII
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
His nets for them were so frightening!
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
Who’s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
XIII, XIV
………………….. 	………………….. 	…………………..
XV
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
What?
Invitations for a meeting?
Three houses will wait for him.
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
What will he choose for his engagement?
With which to start?
In wonder style To every place he came in time.
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning, His bolivar he’s having on	{3]
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
XVI
Its dark.
In sledge he’s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
XYII
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
For theatre Onegin’s speeding. In it each man is free at all:
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Or Cleopatra may encore (By others to be heard once more).
XYIII
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
The tears of the people’s awe. Katenin there could restore
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla’s crowned there.
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
XIX
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
You listen to my grievous call:
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
Shall I again your chorus hear?
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
Shall see emotional flight?
Or dismal eye will never find
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
My disillusioned lornette, Of joy some careless spectator,
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
XX
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
Istómina’s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
With one of feet the floor she’s touching, With other slowly she wheels,
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
XXI
Each claps.
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
Lornette his double slantwise renders To see all ladies to be fit,
He cast a glance at ladies’ tires, At circles but with looks, attires
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
«It’s time to change them in a body,
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressed».
XXII
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
Yet outside, as well’s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
Onegin’s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
XXIII
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
All fashioned model of the creature Who’s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
Philosopher among his mates With them his room he decorates.
XXIV
Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
Rousseau (I’d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasn’t grasping.
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasn’t right.
XXV
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
With age to argue is unfitness; The custom’s despot of the males.
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, We’ll call him dandy for the forth.
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,
In man’s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
XXVI
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
To meet the scholar world’s desire I could describe, you’d be amazed.
Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
XXVII
To other things let’s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
XXVIII
My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed,
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
Came in.
The hall is full of crowd; The music’s weary of sound;
Mazurka is the crowd’s choice; All round are crush and noise;
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
XXIX
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
It’s better place for passing letters fit.
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!
To you I’ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
I’d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
If not... if not, let God deliver!
I write it, as for long my time I haven’t any sin of mine.
XXX
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I’ve ruined much of own life.
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
I like teenage’s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But it’s a stress
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
Ah! I’ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.
Sad and cold,
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
XXXI
In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
To touch in splendid admiration.
Is it high time as I forgot
For you the glory and the laud, The father’s land, incarceration?
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
XXXII
Diana’s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I can’t be appraising,
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth,
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
XXXIII
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armid’s pretty lips,
Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
XXXIV
But other times in mind I bear!
I saw myself in cherished dream
To keep the happy stirrup dare...
Meanwhile small foot in hands l feel;
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
The talkative my lyre’s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
They don’t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
XXXV
What’s my Onegin?
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drums’s beat.
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
The morning pleasant noise arose.
Each shutter’s open, and dry
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
XXXVI
Of ballet’s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.
His life’s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?
XXXVII
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
XXXVIII
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.
Child-Harold’s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
XXXIX, XL, XLI ………………….. 	………………….. 	…………………..
XLII
Of higher world the queer ladies!
The first he made - he left you all;
It’s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we can’t endure,
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
XLIII
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
By him were left at your employments.
Apostate of wild enjoyments,
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didn’t join the guild existent
Of men, whom I can’t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.
XLIV
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each other’s brains;
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
In all of them restriction’s queer; Antiquity the old backs.
The novelty with ages smacks.
Like women, books were all left here,
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
XLV
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,
I was his friend some while ago.
I liked his features in the past:
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
I was embittered, he… unfit.
We knew the game of passion’s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
XLVI
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
He hasn’t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
Great charm to any conversation.
At first his language me confused,
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
XLVI1
And often in the summer’s sphere, When clear is the sky at night
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
Do not reflect Diana’s features, Recalling bygone novel’s creatures,
Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
By night’s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while he’s sleeping,
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
XLVIII
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Neva’s stream,
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
More sweet, than joys beneath the moon, Will stay of Torkwat’s octaves tune!
XLIX
Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
Appolo’s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
I love him, he’s my kin in-law.
Italian nights I shall adore.
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
Sometimes she’s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola I’ll travel
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarka’s language ‘I love you’ .
L
But will it come, my day of freedom?
Its time! - I everyday appeal.
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
Should I begin my freedom flight.
It’s time to leave for life the tight
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
LI
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
Or may be guessed from far away That uncle his would pass away.
LII
Report for him was so sudden From steward:
“Uncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew he’d be glad”.
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud
(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry,
On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.
LIII
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
He’s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
LIV
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
In country tedium’s prevailing Without palaces or streets,
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
Khandra pursued him, always waiting,
It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
LV
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
For flying glory don’t long.
The same I was in time of wisdom,
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
LVI
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you I’m staunch a friend.
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
Like Byron, poet of grace. Or it’s impossible or faithless
To write about otherself As if about ownself?
LVII
All poets, meanwhile I’ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living,
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
But now, friends, from all my sides -
‘Of whom your own lyre sighs?’ By you I’m often briskly questioned, -
‘To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?’
LVIII
’Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
For thoughtful singing with attention?’
‘And whom your lovely verse adored?’
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
But road alarm of love then filled me.
All that I gladlessly survived.
He’s blessed, who with his love combined
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
Arid, following Petrarka’s tracks, Could calm his heart’s the biggest trouble.
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
LIX
The love’s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
I’m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/
I write, and heart yet isn’t boring, The pen unwitting isn’t drawing
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girl’s small feet and no heads.
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
LX
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
From novel’s only beginning — I’ve finished now chapter one.
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,
But never wanted to correct; To censorship I’ll pay my debt;
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
You get along the Neva’s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
CHAPTER TWO
O , rus!
Hor
O Russia!
I
The hamlet, where Eugene’s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
On river’s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
II
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
All’s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I don’t know why.
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
III
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
IV
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
In country’s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
V
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshky’s sounds hear),
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
’He’s ignoramus’, said the neighbours, ’He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
From glass not stopping For a while’. He never kisses hands of ladies,
Says yes or no, never да-с Or нет-с’(the words, they all would pass).
VI
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With Göttingen in soul frankly,
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kant’s ideas and his moves.
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
VII
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
His soul’s warmed with inspiration By lady’s greetings, friendly kind.
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
VIII
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.
IX
Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goethe’s, Shiner’s places hiking,
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
X
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
Like thoughts of simple lady’s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
In deserts of the heaven’s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
XI
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
But landlords of the country’s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation’s lint, -
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
XII
He’s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
Such custom’s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...
XIII
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
They friends became.
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
Have less in difference between Each one.
At first they’d nothing seen In common.
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
Such men (I’m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
XIV
But even such a friendship, readers, We haven’t now; each of us
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
He differed people in effect, And other’s passions could respect.
XV
To Lensky he could listen smiling.
His ardent talk was full of haze;
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
And great belief in world’s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
Of young delirium high rage.
XVI
Each topic’s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,
On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
XVII
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: He’s blessed, who knew all their pretty
Effects, but stepped away anew; He’s blessed much more, who never knew
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
Who father’s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
XVIII
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
Then we’ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
About other’s restless passions, And other’s love will touch the heart, -
We’ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladies’ hearts.
XIX
But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
XX
Ah, he could love; they don’t now Have anything like real love
Of poet, who’s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare
To comfort sorrow and grief.
And nothing cooled his strong belief:
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
XXI
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
XXII
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
But you forgive him, games in stillness!
He liked the grove’s timid thickness,
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret torment’s gladness...
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
XXIII
She’s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
XXIV
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify
The novel’s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
Why not? It’s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
Reminiscence of old time, Of maiden’s room!
We must meanwhile
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can’t adhere
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
XXV
But well, she’s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister’s pretty grace,
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She’d catch one’s eyes by simple face.
She’s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, she’s often frightened,
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
Yet being child, in children’s throng To play and jump had none desire,
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
XXVI
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
And drifting of the country’s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
Her tender fingers didn’t dare To take a needle; she could never
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
Importantly repeats for doll The mother’s lessons, though small.
XXVII
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didn’t play with doll;
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn’t talk at all,
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
Tatyana hadn’t any trends To play with them in any weather:
She’s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
XXVIII
On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
And gradually rises day.
In winter, when the night’s weak shade
Possesses half of world existing Much longer, in the softened loom
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
At usual hour stirred up, In candle’s light she’s getting up.
XXIX
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughter’s bed till day was dreaming
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
XXX
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
Was talking much of them with pride.
For husband then she was yet bride.
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
XXXI
Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
XXXII
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasn’t smoothed by any chance:
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
The way to keep her man away! And everything became o’key.
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
XXXIII
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady’s album if by chance,
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden’s names by names from France,
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian “н” in French best manner
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
XXXIV
Her husband’s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
XXXV
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
XXXVI
And so grew they old both.
But soon for husband, all at once,
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
XXXVII
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
At neighbour’s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
‘Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
And wondered: would he be alive?’
Sincerely, in grief embracing
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
XXXVIII
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,
The ashes patriarchal honoured.
Alas! On furrows of lives
New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
XXXIX
Meanwhile in life you try to revel, As much as I you take form it!
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
To leave the world I would he sorry.
I live and write not for applause,
But, seems to me I’d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory.
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
XL
The heart of somebody he’ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
Perhaps, in Lethe won’t perish My verse, by wit and heart well made;
Perhaps, in front of portrait famous, To people future ignoramous
Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It’s poet of grace!’
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
CHAPTER THREE
Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
Malfilatre.
I
‘What way?
You poets, are queer!’ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
‘I don’t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
-To Larin’s -’Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings daily…
Forgive me, isn’t it too hard?’ -For me it’s not - ‘But dear bard,
I don’t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests it’s always zealous,
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horses’ stall…’
II
-In this I see yet no troubles…
‘But trouble is: they are such bores’.
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
And there… -
‘For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
I’m sorry that you go… well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
For tears, rhymes and so on?… Present me her’.
- D’you joke -
‘No’.
-I’m glad. - ‘but when?’ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
III
-Let’s go.- They were quietly driven,
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
All services of old time.
It was well known friendly wellcome:
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
IV
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
Let’s listen, yet without labour, To their talking, short indeed.
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
‘My habit,..
I…’ -But you are boring
Much more... -
‘Well, no, just the same...
The field is dark in pretty gale...
Andryushka, quicker must you go!
What foolish, dumpy is this place!
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
And I’m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
V
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?’ -That girl, which’s always so sad;
She’s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
‘But do you love, indeed, the other?’ -And what? -
‘But I’d prefer another,
If I were poet like you.
Of life her features have but few.
Like in van Dick’s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, she’s boon
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizon’s foolish brightness’.
Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry.
VI
Meanwhile Onegin’s stay at Larin’s Was estimated like a news,
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
They joked, not without sin At Tanya’s suitor made a hint.
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
About Lensky’s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
VII
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
Made all young heart to pine away, For someone did her soul wait.
VIII
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
All’s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
She doesn’t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
IX
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novel’s beings,
Like Julie’s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty,
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
X
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forest’s still
With dangerous book alone’s hiking, In it reveals she so striking
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
But hero, I’m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
XI
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
XII
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
The vice, that’s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, who’s lost in thought,
Or vagrant Melmoth, such distressful, Or Corsair, or Eternal Jew,
Or Sbogar, mythical a few.
Lord Byron with his whim successful Enveloped fussy egoism In hopeless romanticism.
XIII
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future won’t be
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself I’ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
Will take the twilight of my days.
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
Past clans; the charming dreams of love, Antique moralities beloved.
XIV
In them I’ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
Of bold children’s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
And I’ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.
XV
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
With you I now tears shed;
Of tyrant you didn’t fear, But now he your fate has had.
You’ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
XVI
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
In dark my Tanya’s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
XVII
‘...can’t sleep, it’s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...’
-But what is it -
‘You tell of those Your old times... I’ve boring tide..’
-But what about?
I had happened To know many old legends,
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
My memory is dark.., I’m granny... And much forgot... of life the line
Is drawn, in turn I’ve bad nay time.
My poor mind...
- You tell me, nanny,
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
XVIII
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
Or otherwise I’d be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-
‘But how did you marry, nanny?’ -It was by wish of God.
My Vanny Was younger, than myself I mean, And I was, dear, yet thirteen.
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
My father gave consent to wed.
In fear I was crying, darling,
In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
XIX
And I’m in family unknown...
But are you listening yet to me?
‘Well... I, my nanny… don’t know... For love I’m longing, dear me!
To cry, to weep I’m now ready...’ -I see, you are unwell already
My dear God, you bless and save!
What do you want to ask, you say!
But let me help with sacred water.
You are in heat.- - But I’m not ill Well... nanny, I’m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
XX
‘I fell in love’, again she whispers In nurse’s ear in dismay.
-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-
‘I fell in love... you’d get away
Meanwhile the moon was brightly shining, By languid light it was enlightning
Tatyana’s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
XX I
While at the moon Tatyana’s looking, By own heart away she’s gone...
Of mind some vague a thought is moving...
‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
You give a pen and paper, dear, I’ll stay in bed; make table near;
Forgive me’.
Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon
She’s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugene’s kept in mind,
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
The letter’s ready, has been fit...
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
XXII
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
May be, you saw at Neva’s banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.
XXIII
Among admirers obedient I’ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
XXIV
But why Talyana should be guilty?
Because she’s innocent and plain,
Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
Because ire, truthfulness she’s swift? Because from heavens got as gift
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
But can’t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
XXV
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
For love she’s dedicated truly Like loyal child for mother’s nest,
She doesn’t say: ‘Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
XXVI
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
I have without any doubts Tatyana’s letter to translate.
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
That’s why in French she’s always writing.
Alas! I must repeat again:
A lady’s love until to-day To speak her Russian isn’t trying,
And proud language’s now lit For prose postal a bit.
XXYII
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
What’s the end?
You’ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
My poets! I’d like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
XXVIII
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
I don’t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
Perhaps I’ll grieve if in a while
Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journal’s call:
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
But I… it doesn’t bother me: To old times I’ll loyal be.
XXIX
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
To have remorse I haven’t forces; Like Bogdanovich’s all verses I’d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty’s letter I should use.
But I am ready to refuse As its translation isn’t easy.
I know: Parny’s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
XXX
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
With my request immodest, gladless I’d trouble you for helping me:
To make your dear magic tuning Of beauty’s passion mood, resuming
Some foreign words, she often writes.
But where are you? Come! My rights
To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
But in gloomy cliffs
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
He’s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
XXXI
In hands I have Tatyana’s letter. It’s kept by me with sacred sigh.
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness who’s admired?
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madman’s hearty mock.
It’s both harmful and absorbing.
All that I don’t grasp.
Let’s read
My bad translation incomplete. Its like of picture poor copy; Or like of
«Freischutz» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.
Tatyana’s letter to Onegin.
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, You’ll never leave me such unfit.
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame You’d guess, as I would well behave
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
They say, you are a lone guy, In country’s stillness you are boring.
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
What for you visited all us?
In village, in forgotten stillness Of you I’d never know, thus I wouldn’t know tortures sleepless.
Of agitated soul’s feelings
With time I’d smooth and then might be I’d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
Some other...
But to no person In all the world I’d give my heart,
It’s all decided (it’s my version) By heavens board: I’m yours at heart.
My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;
I know, you were sent by goodness, You’ll be my guard until the end,
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
And then I thought: He’s now in;
It’s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
That instant I could trunk with reason
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?
You help my doubts to resolve:
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
For changes fated anyhow...
Let it be so: you have had
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
Imagine: I’m alone, thus From no man have understanding...
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
I stop!
I dread to read again...
In fear shameful heart is sinking.
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
XXXII
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter’s trembling on her palm, The wafer’s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
Her head to shoulder’s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
But now radiant moon’s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it’s all the same.
XXXIII
She doesn’t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isn’t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse already’s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, it’s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!
My dear early little bird!
Last evening frightful words I’d heard; Thank God!
I see you strong already!
Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-
XXXIV
‘Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?’ -All right, my dear, you command.-
‘D’you think.’ indeed... suspicions any… But do you see...
Ah, don’t mind’ -My friend, by God to hail I dare —
‘You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!’… -To whom, my dear?
Tell again, You see, I’m now muddle-headed.
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
XXXV
‘What slow-witted you are, nyanya!’ -I’m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barin’s will I’d rather…-
‘Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, I’m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Onegin’ -Well done dealing.
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
But you are pale... What are you feeling? ‘It’s nothing, nanny, not at all.
But send your boy, and first of all’ .
XXXVI
The day had gone, but no answer...
Next day has come...
She’s up at once, Like shade she’s pale, but no answer...
Well dressed, she’s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
‘And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.’.
Tatyana’s flushing, all she’s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
XXXVII
It’s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
By Olga’s hand the tea’s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyana’s standing, She’s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted window’s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
XXXVIII
Meanwhile her soul’s feelings moan, Her tears filled her languid glance...
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
They rush into the yard at once!
‘Ah, Eugene!’, - She is quickly running, Like shade she’s prompt, to exit’s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back it’s hard; In short a minute she’s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
XXXIX
Has fallen…
‘Here’s He! that’s Eugene!
My God! what thoughts could come to him!’
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
She’s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesn’t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
Maiden’s Song
Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,
Let us play inventfully, Lot us play more happily,
Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,
Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly
Let’s away get rapidly, Him bespatter easily
With the berries laughingly, Don’t hear secretly
Maiden’s singing intimate, Don’t peep invisibly
At the games of maidenhood.
XL
But she’s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
But doesn’t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hare’s trembling
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
XLI
At last she’s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
is going, and when she’s trying To turn aside... is coming up
Just He! His gaze on her he’s fixing, Like dreadful shade for her he’s reaching,
And she, as if she’s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
To have a rest and have a hike, That’s why I’ll finish other time.
CHAPTER FOUR
La morale est dans 					la natura des choses.
Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things.
I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier she’s liking us,
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
Of praised grandfather’s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
VIII
Who isn’t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?
Whom don’t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
Love-letter secrets on six sheets, The fraud, the gossip, rings, the tears,
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendship’s heavy haze?
IX
That was the way of Eugene’s thinking.
In his first youth he was untrained,
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
By habits of the life he’s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
He’s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
To protests of soul’s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
X
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy
For evening whist who’s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
XI
Onegin got Tatyana’s message. It quickly touched his soul’s strings:
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maiden’s dreams.
In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
He didn’t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
For garden now we shall fleet In which she’s got with him to meet.
XII
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
And. told her:
‘To me you wrote, Do not deny.
I’ve read it up:
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l don’t want;
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
XIII
‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
If by the family best vision For instant I’d be charmed with reason,-
Believe, I’d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
I’ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,
Alone you, to speak my mind, I’d take as friend of days my grievous,
Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!
XI
‘I’m not quite made to be much happy. My soul’s alien for bliss;
Perfections yours make speech my gappy, Of them I’m not yet worthy, miss.
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used I’d run from you;
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
But they would madden it too hard.
What roses, you can be judging,
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
XV
‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
Who’s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
He’s always frowned, taciturn, He’s chilly, jealous, angry turned!
That’s what I am.
Indeed, you won’t With all your pure flaming heart
Be glad with such a man… You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
Indeed, d’you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
XVI
‘My dreams and years won’t rather Return to make me new a bit,
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
In early spring of every year.
You see, by skies its predestined:
You’ll fall in love once more and find… You learn to rule yourself: I fear
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles brings’
XVII
This way my Eugene was her teaching.
Through tears never seeing him,
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
Did try to make of that some fun: The country’s freedom has its own
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
XVIII
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
Ah, many friends were near then!
With reason I remembered them.
XIX
And what?
It’s right.
I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
In brackets I would like to note: You haven’t more insulting lie,
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
With might and main he’ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
XX
H’m, h’m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk o’key?
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
What does the kinsfolk mean namely?
It means the following thing mainly:
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
And by the people’s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
We them remind about us...
And let them God long live for us!
XXI
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
It’s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
Opinions of the worldly might...
And fair sex like down’s slight...
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
Most be respected for the life. And true girl-friend in love’s adjustment
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
XXII
But whom to love?
Whom you’d be trusting?
Who’s that, which never us betrays?
Who’s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
Who helps from slander not to perish?
Who carefully us can cherish?
To whom my vice is not a harm?
Who never bores us by his charm?
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
Such subject’s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
XXIII
What was the sequence of the meeting?
Alas, it’s easy to divine!
Of love mad sufferings she’s feeling . Without ceasing for a while
In young sad soul’s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
Ali that has gone like sound’s fizz, And dear Tanya’s youth all dwindles:
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
XXIV
Alas, Tatyana’s daily fading: She’s paling, sinking and is mute,
She’s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldn’t give a hoot..
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
It’s time, its time to marry her!
But it’s enough to speak of her:
I’d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanya’s dear heart indeed.
XXV
Each minute more is captivated By Olga’s beauty so young,
By bondage Lensky’s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
With her he’s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
Or in the garden hand in hand They walk at morning so grand;
And what?
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olga’s frock.
XXVI
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
Whose author bolter nature’s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
Meanwhile some two or three of pages (Some idle gibberish or fables,
But dangerous for the maiden’s heart) Quite reddenning he’s missing up.
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
XXVII
When he’s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;
In them he draws the country whole, The Kyprid’s temple, graves alone:
Or on the lyre draws a dove With pens and paints, with all his love;
Or on the leaves for recollections, Of other signatures beneath
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.
XXVIII
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maiden’s album big,
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
As sign of friendship’s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
The first of leaflets just can show: Qu’ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
It’s signed by t.a.v.
Annette; And on the last one you read so:
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
XXIX
Without fail you’ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torch’s rays;
You’ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I’d like to write,
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards they’ll not endure
Maliciously discuss with smiles: If I was sharp or dull in lies,
XXX
But uncoordinated volumes From devil’s library all got,
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,
Or Baratinsky with his pen,- Let be you birnt by thunder then!
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
XXXI
Not madrigals my Lensky’s writing In Olga’s album, and indeed
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
XXXII
But hist!
D’you hear?
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
Of elegy’s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
He shouts: ‘Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!’
-it’s right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead you’ll give a hope;
Is not it so, friend?
- Not, then!
You write the odes, gentlemen,
XXXIII
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..’
-Just solemn odes you could hear!
Enough, my friend, its all the same!
-What said the satirist, remember!
Is cunning liric, who can render
The ‘else’s trends’, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
‘But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
Meanwhile they most be not a mock, But honourable..!’ - l could here
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages don’t want.
XXXIV
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
His own works?
They say, they’d got For that the best in world reward.
Indeed, he’s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
He’s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
XXXV
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
Alone to my nurse, who’s being My old friend from youth and forth.
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
I’m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.
XXXVI, XXXVII
And what’s Onegin doing?
Brothers!
I ask: be patient for a time;
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
The Gulnare’s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
And then he dressed himself...
XXXVIII, XXXIX
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
Onegin’s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
XL
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but don’t we. confess.
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
XLI
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
You’d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
He doesn’t gather them with horn. A maiden’s singing in her house,
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinter’s crackling making light.
XLII
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
Its here: take it and be ‘tackling’ !) All look like silver snowy fields...
More pretty than a parquette fashioned, The river, clad in ice, is flashy,
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:
With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at river’s banks they fall.
XLIII
Such time what can you do in village?
To walk?
The seasons country views
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
To ride a horse in steppe severe?
But then your horse will try in fear
To scratch unfaithful icy path As he’s afraid to fall at last.
Deserted room alone filling You read; it’s Pradt, it’s Walter Scott.
You don’t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
XLIV
Like Harold Child Onegin’s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
At fire-place the table’s lain: Onegin’s waiting - Lensky’s speeding
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid let’s have dinner before rest!
XLV
Of ‘Clicquot widow’ or ‘Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.
I — It sparkles by Hippocrene’s role, It was by own play and foam
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
XLVI
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
It now; but ‘Bordeaux’ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
Which’s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
And you, ‘Bordeaux’ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
‘Bordeaux’ all the times!
XLVII
The fire’s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coal’s crust;
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
The fire-place is fading...
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
A bowl
On table’s hissing yet, forlorn...
The evening darkness comes along...
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
But why? I don’t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
XLUIII
‘But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?’
- To pour half-glass you do a favour...
Enough, my dear...
Healthy all...
Regards of them to you I’m giving.
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
You’ll see: they all become the bosh
Let’s visit them; you’ll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself:
You came two times, but then of self You don’t make them yet reminding
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
XLIX
‘Me?’ - Yes, Tatyana’s name-day happy Will be on Saturday...
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
‘But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
-But no one...
Pm sure... none, They’ll be the family, the one.
Let’s go, do thorn such a favour!
And what? -
‘Agreed’ - You... dear guy!
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
L
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
For his delight were just awaiting.
But Hymen’s troubles, griefs of mating,
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
Meanwhile we all. of Hymen foes, In home life yet see but one
And boring pictures’ row, done In style of La Fontaine’s sweet novels.
My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard.
LI
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
A hundred times is blessed, who’s faithful. Who’s got his wit to be quite calm,
Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
Or tenderer - like little moth Which sucks spring flower with force;
But wretched is, who’s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
CHAPTER FIVE
Oh, don’t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
Zhookovsky
I
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
By winter carpets, snow-made.
All’s blight, all’s white without shade.
II
It’s winter!..
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
A brave sledge-cart from field’s returning, It’s fluffy furrows upturning,
The coachman’s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
A yard boy’s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
While he prefered to play a steed. His finger’s frozen a little,
It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his mother’s finger shakes.
III
But may be those kinds of pictures By now can’t you all attract,
As they are mean and simple features, You won’t see fine art in that.
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winter’s bliss and tinges all:
He’ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
IV
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesn’t know why)
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
The snow’s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
V
Tatyana trusted legend’s fancies Of simple folk’s old times.
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
By many signs she’s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
If she’s seeing
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
VI
She all is trembling, paling, shying.
And when a falling shining star
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isn’t fading,
The wish of heart to whisper her.
And when sometimes in front of her
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
VII
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
To guess the windy youth is trying
Which doesn’t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
VIII
Tatyana’s interest is affected By melting on the fire wax:
It shows traceries affective, Informs of mind’s the secret backs.
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
We sing of their lucky fate And glory!
- All they are yet feeling
Some loss in all the song’s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
IX
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heaven’s bodies light
All flows in a single gear...
Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirror’s aiming down,
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
The snow’s crackling... someone’s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
What is your name? - He’s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphon…
X
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
At once was frightened my Tatyana...
And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
Was too afraid, I must confess...
But with Tatyana shan’t we guess.
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
Her maiden’s mirror yet she keeps.
It all is still.
Tatyana steeps.
XI
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
Across a glade, all under snow Around which all’s dark and sad.
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isn’t frozen by frost.
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, she’s standing still.
XII
As at the reason of the parting Tatyana’s grumbling at the brook,
She doesn’t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
The snow-drift at once is moving...
And who, d’you think, from it is looking?
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: ‘Ah!’ But he becomes
Polite; with sharp-clawed paw he’s rapping Her hand to offer help; she bends
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful she’s shyly stepping
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runs… the bear’s after her!
XIII
Of looking back she doesn’t dare And hurries up, she’s quickening steps,
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky
The heaven’s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
XIV
She runs for forest... he’s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
To take it up she can’t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
She’s running - he is after her; She can’t be running any more,
XV
She falls on snow - he is swifty: He’s taking her in paws and brings,
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesn’t move and doesn’t breathe;
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
It’s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss they’ve had;
‘There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!’
To inner porch he goes fast, He’s laying down her at last.
X U1
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
One’s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
With goat’s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
A dwarf with tail; and there’s that Who’s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
XVII
But that’s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
At goose’s neck a skull is fateful, It’s whirling round for all sides;
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!
Onegin’s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
XVIII
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;
He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry.
That he’s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pull…
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Onegin’s eyes make tire own,
He’s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
XIX
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly
And can’t; she’s now deeply worrier!, She moans and she’d like to cry...
But can’t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades’ spectres
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: ‘It’s mine! Its mine’
XX
‘It’s mine!’ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanya’s shoulder he bends;
But suddenly her sister’s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she can’t have breath..
XXI
They argue louder; he’s getting Some long a knife; in short a while
He’s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry
Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
In horror Tanya is awaking...
She sees: the room is light again, Through window’s a frosty pane
Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;
Like North Aurora’s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
‘But now tell;’ she says, ‘to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?’
XXII
At sister Tanya isn’t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
This kind of book yet doesn’t show The writer’s fancies in a row,
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Lady’s Fashion Journal had
Less influence on lady’s head; It was, my friends, Martyn Zadeka,
The head of Chaldean wise men, — Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
XXIII
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
Malvina’s works but separated For several roubles he abated,
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
Marmontel’s volume them he gave.
Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
XXIV
That dream aroused her misgivings.
Not grasping ways to understand
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
In book’s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
Etcetera.
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
XXV
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
An Lane’s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.
XXVI
With own wife that’s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children you’d be seeing
From two to thirty years on; The district dandy Petushkóv,
With him my cousin first Buyánov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
(Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired Flyánov,
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
XXVII
With Kharlikóv Panfíl and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
Who left Tambóv without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poet’s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
Was brave instead of ‘elle Nina’ To put the ‘belle Tatiana’
XXVIII
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
He came, What news, such sentimental!
Well have the music regimental!
The colonel sent it for the chance.
What joy: to-day we’ll have to dance!
The girls are jumping all around.
Its time for dinner, Guests have had
To come to tables hand in hand.
Around Tanya ladies crowd,
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
XXIX
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
They don’t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
‘Ah, my Lord!’,
The mistress cries, ‘At last you’ve got!’
In crowd everybody renders:
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
XXX
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
She’s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;
She’s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
XXXI
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.
Like crank by chance at feast enormous He’s angry.
And Tatyana’s nervous
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, he’s being in a whim.
He’s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lensky’s head For sufferings, he here had.
Already for triumph he’s waiting,
And he invents by whim’s requests Caricatures of the guests.
XXXII
Of course, Onegin’s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
Zhizhi, my soul’s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
XXXIII
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence now’s keeping.
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
And she has had
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
XXXIV
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, he’s admired;
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
Such charming, tender.
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
Or, like coquette, he simply boomed? By his good will Or willy-nilly
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tama’s heart.
XXXV
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
XXXVI
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
They all replaced for each of roberts; The tea’s been brought.
I could define
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
Every country eater
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
In brackets to the point I’d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX
The tea’s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga Petushkóv then whirls,
With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age,
By hard from big Tambóv’s engaged; Buyhánov whirls with Pustyakóva,
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
XL
At the beginning of my novel — (In chapter first you look it all)
I’d like to use the Alban’s model: In Petersburg to show ball.
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
Of known ladies feet and legs.
But by your narrow small tracks,
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
The further I’m from youth my gay,
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine.
XLI
Monotonous and sometimes yet senseless, Like whirlwind of the youthful lives,
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
Then he for her a chair’s finding, They speak about this and that,
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again he’s dancing.
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
XLII
Mazurka’s sounding.
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquet’s cracks wee heard again.
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
Mazurka now all its rating, Initiative beauties keeps:
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
XLIII, XLIV
Buyánov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
Lensky saw
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
XLV
But yet she can’t.
And what’s the reason?
Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
Onegin.
Goodness me, it isn’t For him to hear!
What a whim...
Impossible!?
She’s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
And. so cunny, she is gay. Already’s able to betray!
He can’t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
Two pistols in a row,
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
CHAPTER SIX
La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui i’morir non dole.
Petrarka 			Where days are cloudy and short 			A tribe was there born 			For which to die makes no hurt. (It.)
I
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
And Olga’s yawning; round here She’s looking for her Lensky dear.
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
At last it stopped.
All have the supper.
The beds are made. And any guest
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maiden’s.
All they utter
A need for sleep.
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
II
All’s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy Pustyakóv
With own heavy hall, his dear; Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.
Monsieur Triquet is on the floor, In jersey, capped, not far from door.
In Tanya’s, Olga’s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
At window alone, sad (Diana’s ray lights up, her wakens)
My poor Tanya sits, can’t sleep, And looks into the darkling field.
III
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
By got by Olga strange tuition She’s touched, in depth of soul sighs;
She’s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
She’s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foe’s hand
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
‘I’ll perish, - says my Tanya’s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.
I don’t grudge: why should I grudge?
He can’t give happiness at large’.
IV
But forward, forward, you, my story!
My muse new person just reveals.
Some several miles from Krasnogóry, From Lensky’s village, there lives
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
Zarétsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. — Hut now simply good the head
Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
V
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:
At Verrey’s every morning’s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
VI
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;
VII
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
‘Sed alia temporal’ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC.
VIII
He’s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that’s why at borne
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
But after first cordial greeting Zaretsky’s silent for a while
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
IX
It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didn’t want:
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
Alone with his soul’s self Unsatisfied was by himself.
X
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasn’t right at all
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
It is forgivable.
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
XI
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
But at least
It’s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
Is spoiled by old duels fan, He’s evil, gossip, talking man...
Of course, he thinks, ‘I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..’
Opinion of the public mournful!
The spring of honour, idol last!
Yet does it whirl the world and us:
XII
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
And now jealouser’s triumphant!
He was afraid of being answered
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
Of enemy from pistol parried.
But now doubts all are solved:
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
XIII
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didn’t want
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun he’s looking on...
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
His Olga’s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
She’s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
XIV
‘What for you early disappeared?’
Was asking Olya him at once
My Lensky’s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
He looks al her with tender ardour; He’s yet beloved with previous force,
He’s now languished by remorse, He’s being ready to beg pardon,
He’s trembling, loses fitting words, He’s happy, has improved his health,
XV, XVI, XVII
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
He thinks of here:
‘I’ll be defender; I’ll not endure when offender
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
Or when a worm disdained and deadly Is growing out lily’s stem
Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintly’.
My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine I’ve shooting things.
XVIII
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyana’s heart was burnt!
It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
On earth, then might be by her love She’d joined the friends the day above!
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
XIX
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: ‘I’ve my happy days...’
But it is late, it’s time to go...
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
At him she stares all the way:
‘What’s happened?’- `Nothing’… - Gets away.
XX
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shiller’s work.
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesn’t slumber,
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
XXI
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
‘Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
What does next day for me prepare?
In vain I try to be aware,
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
All’s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
XXII
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
Some tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,’ to thinks
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!’
My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, I’m husband yours by love!"
XXIII
His verse is sluggish and obscure (It’s called romanticism by us;
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on table’s falling
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
‘It’s seven soon, it’s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to wait’.
He was mistaken: sleeping fair — Onegin then for world was dead,
The shades of night are now rare And Vesper’s met by cock ahead.
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
From bed Onegin wasn’t moving, The dream yet flies about him.
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtain’s moving
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.
XXV
He hurries up to ring.
His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
Onegin’s quick to dress. Already His sernant’s ordered to be ready
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
The sledge for race is now ready, In it he’s flying to the mill;
Has come; to servant says he will Lepage’s fatal barrels steady
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
XXVI
My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
Onegin’s coining with excuses.
Zaretsky to behave refuses: ‘But where is the second yours?’
In duels classic, pedant cross
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
He didn’t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
As legends say of old age (For that we’d praise in him the sage).
XXVII
’My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait.
I can’t foresee any objection To this representation made.
Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!’
Zaretsky’s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Perhaps,’ says Lensky.
And quickly both they yet off
Behind the mill.
Meanwhile far off The honest person and Zaretsky
Grand treaty’s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
XXVIII
The foes!
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
Of daily troubles.
Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful,
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
Prepare ruins once for ever...
They’d better laugh before they had
With blood sustained each pure hand... They’d bel.ter part in friendly manner...
The enmity’s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
XXIX
The pistols all are now shining, The hammer’s jingling at the lock,
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistol’s cock.
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
And stands at stint
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
The foes put the capes on steppe.
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
XXX
‘You now meet...’ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
Four fatal for the life the stages...
His pistol then Onegin raises
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
The clock’s been striking
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
XXXI
On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.
His misty, foggy gaze
Expresses death but not the torture.
From mountains descends this way
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
He looks, he calls him - all’s for nothing!
He isn’t more… The youngling bard
Has found end untimely hard!
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar’s gone.
XXXII
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow’s languid peace.
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
But like a house all deserted It’s dark and still, and not by chance
It’s mute for ever all at once.
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
The master’s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
XXXIII
It’s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
It’s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
Unwittingly in mirror’s peeping Ashamed to recognize: he’s beaten;
Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!
And much the more it’s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures won’t be the best.
XXXIV
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
XXXY
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
‘Well, he is killed’,- the neighbour said.
He’s killed!..
By dreadful exclamation Onegin’s shuddered; slain, impatient
To call some people gets away.
Zaretsky cautiously could lay
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, He’s taking home dreadful hoard,
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
XXXVI
My friends, on bard you’d have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadn’t time
But withered!
Where’s agitation And honourable aspiration
Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
XXXVII
He, might be, for the world’s welfare Or even for the fame was born;
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
For centures to make him known.
On steps of world the bard might go
Upstairs to the highest rate.
But his such sufferable shade,
It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
He’ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
XXXVIII, XXX1X
It might he other: he’d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
The youthful years would be fading, The soul’s heat would not be hot
In many trends he’d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
XL
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young lover’s lot:
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
XLI
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
A shepherd bast gay sandal’s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
At brook the monument is seeing She’s drawing made of leather rein,
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
XLII
And slowly through fields she’s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soul’s filled
She thinks:
‘Whith Olga what could happen?
Or not for long her heart was shattered
And passed away of tears time?
And where is her sister line?
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?’
Meantime account, made for you, In details I shall give to you,
XLIII
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
Of course, of him I’ll quickly know,- For him I now haven’t time.
My age inclines for strict a prose, Against light rhymes my age arose
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soul’s quiet dream.
XLIV
I’ve heard some voice of new desire, I’ve got new sorrow anew;
By new one can’t I be admired I pity old one - it’s true.
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
And is it true, it can’t return?
And am I soon at thirties turn?
XLV
It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
O’key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me!
I’m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
To you I’m greatful!
You alone Among anxieties in still
Could me enjoy... I’ve had my fill; It is enough!
With clear soul
New way I’m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.
XLVI
Let me look back.
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul’s haze.
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
You don’t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
CHAPTER SEVEN
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
Dmitriyev.
How would you not love Moscow?
Baratynsky.
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
Where is it better?
Where we have never been.
Griboyedov
I
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
By clear smile the nature’s fitting Through dream the year’s morning meeting
The shining skies are now blued.
Yet limpid is the near wood
As if by greenish down covered.
A bee to fields, of tribute well,
Is flying from the waxy cell.
Are drying valleys many-coloured;
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
II
Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the country’s still!
Or am I stranger to enjoyments, To all that gladdens and revives,
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead?
III
Or aren’t we glad to see returning Of perished in the autumn leaves
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forest’s thicks?
Or with the nature just reviving We close in, confused by minding
The withering of own days, Which can’t revive by any ways?
May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
IV
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
V
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winter’s mirth you’d had.
With dear muse of mine capricious Let’s hear forest’s noise delicious
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
VI
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for river’s crook.
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
‘Vladimir Lensky here’s lain, He met his death like man quite hold
At such a year, such an age.
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!’
VII
On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
But now...
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
Decayed...
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,
The shepherd’s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
VIII, IX, X
My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn’t be.
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
That uhlan’s loved by all her soul… At altar now does she stand
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
XI
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
Or sleeping over the Lethe The poet is quiet, easy,
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
All yet living
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
XII
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larin’s soon forever went:
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldn’t cry,
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
XIII
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
XIV
And in the solitude severe Her passion’s heating yet much more,
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
But he’s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
What for to grieve?
XV
The evening sky’s more dark.
The waters Are still.
Some noise by beetle’s raised.
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
The fisher’s fire.
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
In own dreams all’s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
She looks, and all her own heart More often’s heating and more hard.
XVI
The doubts all confused her soul:
‘Shall go forth or should return?..
He isn’t here...
I’m unknown...
I’ll take a look and then turn’,
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
Bewildered and astonished hard...
She enters a deserted yard.
All barking, dogs to her are running.
At her much frightened loud cries
Of yard boys family just flies.
Ran up and not without fighting
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
XYII
May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.
As quick as can
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novel’s crank.
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
And with a bow
The woman says:
‘At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
XVIII
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
You now come to rooms, the inner...
And here is the banns room.
He slept and coffee had he here, His menager’s reports could hear,
A book at mornings here read...
And old barin room this had;
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
To play the cards was used with me.
Let give the God his soul chances
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!’
XIX
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soul’s rate
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
XX
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
It’s late.
Some cold wind just blows.
It’s dark in valleys.
Rather well The grove sleeps.
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet she’s sighing once again
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
XXI
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
And in a day
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby
For long is weeping she this time.
But then with books she could be dealing.
At first of them she didn’t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
XXII
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:
In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
Is pictured rather well correctly With his immoral soul wry,
Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
XXIII
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.
Tatyana’s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
At margins of the books she’s meeting Of reader’s pencil slightest signs:
Onegin’s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
XXIV
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
Thank God, more clearly - she’s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy
Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry,
What’s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
Of stylish words some ready set?
Is he a parody not yet?
XXV
Is really the secret’s found?
Or really she guessed not wrong?
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
‘You see, Tatyana’s not a child,’ The old woman’s voice is mild,-
‘Of them my Olga is the younger.
To fix her fate it’s time, I see;
What shall I do, I can’t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
‘Do not.’
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
XXVI
’But may be she’s in love?’ ‘Who knows?
Buyánov courted: was refused.
To Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuse
Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what d’you think? again collapse!’
‘Well, dear me, what is the matter?
For fair of the brides her bring,
To Moscow, they need good things.’..,
‘Ah, father my! the profit’s worsened..’.
‘For single winter it will do, At least I’ll credit money you’…
XXVII
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
She courted… at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
This news Tatyana quickly hears.
To judgings by the world severe
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
XXVIII
She’s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
‘Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
And you forgive, my freedom later!
For what and where do I strive?
And what can give me fate of mine?’
XXIX
Much longer now she is hiking, But now brook and now hill
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
She hurries up to have a chat.
But summer’s flying quicker yet.
The autumn golden is coming, The nature’s now trembling, pale
Like victim under charming veil.
And now North, all clouds driving,
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
XXX
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
But Tanya’s heart yet isn’t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
Can’t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
XXXI
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
Well, many trifles like the bra.
Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
XXXII
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfast’s ready in the room.
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
On jade postillion’s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beard’s shaggy.
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
Boom could fade.
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
‘Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
Forgive, secluded my asylum!
But shall I see you?’ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
XXXIII
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;
At any sides we’ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
XXXIV
We haven’t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
The inns are absent.
Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
A menu hangs for order’s sake And teases appetite in vain.
Meanwhile the Cyclops of the village In front of dimmish forge’s light
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
XXXV
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winter’s even every way.
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
XXXVI
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry,
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
You, Moscow, I thought of you!
My Moscow... in this lunation
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
XXXVII
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
It in strain
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didn’t come at all to him
My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
XXXVIII
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
Go on!
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
XXXIX, XL
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
At Kharitónya’s in the alley In front of house at the gate
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
XLI
- Princess, mon ange! -
‘Pachette!’- Alina!
‘Who might be thinking... all the time!
For how long?
My cousin dear, Sit down... complex is the life!
My God, a scene from novels dear...’ -And that’s my daughter...
Tanya, near!
‘Ah, Tanya!
Dear! come to rue… As in a dream it seems to be...
D’you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?’
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
Well, I remember... has he gone?
At Simeon’s he’s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
XLII
And that... but afterwards you’ll know, Is not it true?
With kin to meet
To-morrow we’ll Tanya show...
But I can hardly drag my feet,
To be with you I cannot go...
But you are tortured by the road.
Let’s come together... take a rest...
I haven’t force... is tired breast…
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
For nowhere am I smart...
With age the life is such a badness...’
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
XLIII
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels
Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
Nor makes get up without choosing.
At window she now sits.
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields she’s now looking:
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
XLIV
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
And exclamations at the board:
‘What big is Tanya!
Is it not
That recently I was you christening?’
I was taking you in hands!
‘And I your ears pulled by hands!’
‘And I was gingebread you giving!’
And all grandparents exclaim: ’But how years fly away!’
XLV
In them you can’t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
Is whitening on Lukérya Lvovna, The same yet lies Lytibóv Petróvna.
Iván Petróvich’s fool and bore, Semyón Petróvich stints yet more;
With Pelagéya Nikolávna The same’s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
The same is dog, the same’s her man Which is of club the loyal number,
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
XLVI
My Tanya’s hugged by their daughters.
Of Moscow young graces good
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet she’s looking rather slim;
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden’s choice,
XLVII
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
In tender manner they agree.
But Tanya now like in dream
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
XLVIII
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
In talks all’s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
XLIX
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
At boring aunt’s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
L
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
While she’s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
Or where Thalia’s stilly dreaming To friendly claps yet isn’t listening;
Or where Terpsichore one Amazes all the public young
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
LI
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once one’s feelings strikes.
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
And unattentive smart lornette.
On leave the gussars hasten here
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
LII
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heaven’s blue
Among the friends the moon’s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
But She whom I yet don’t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
With heavenly her pride she’s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
Of what a languor’s full her breast?
What languid is her gaze guile charming:
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
LIII
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.
Meanwhile
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this world’s fuss she’s hatred feeling.
She’s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.
LIV
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
Meanwhile his eyes off her can’t tear Some general important, grand.
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
And whispered her each one of them: ‘You look left side at those men…’
‘Left side?.. but where? what is there?’ I ‘It doesn’t matter, but you look,
D’you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
He stepped away... he turned a bit..’-
‘But who? plump general that big?’
LV
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
Let’s turn the route we now here To keep in mind of whom I sing...
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend I’m now singing,
Of multiplied his own crank.
You now bless long years’ work
My muse in ethics well embodied!
To me true compass now lend
Haphazard wander to prevent.
Enough... and has been done the burden:
Well, I saluted classicism! It’s late, but preface has been seen.
CHAPTER EIGHT
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
Byron
I
That time, when in lyceum’s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didn’t read,
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
My student’s cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit,
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
II
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
III
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
IV
I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
She’s after me.
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
By sorcery of story’s secrets!
At rocks of the Caucasian districts
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.
And often at Taurida’s beaches She brought me in the have of night
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
V
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
Of words for songs of prairie districts...
But suddenly was changed it all:
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
VI
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
VII
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
What for yet here has he been?
Who’s he?
Not Eugene he’s at most?
But really?
Yes, It is he...
For long has chance with us to be?
VIII
Is he the same or quiet now?
Or, as before, he plays the crank?
What kind’s he now anyhow?
And what for is can now lurid?
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
Or will he be a lad good natured Like you and I, like all the world?
At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole world…
D’you know?...
- Yes and no yet.
IX
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
The folly’s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0
X
He’s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He’s blessed, who well in time was ripe.
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
XI
Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
Have been decayed in nature’s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
XII
As object of the judging noisy, In life you’d never have a wish:
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
Or kind of madcap; sad a version Of some Satanic ugly person,
Or even own demon mine. Onegin (him I’ll occupy),
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
XIII
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
XIV
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
To hostess a lady’s heading, Some plump grand general’s behind.
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
She doesn’t glare at the rest, And doesn’t claim to have success;
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricks…
She’s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,
Do comme il faut… (Shishkov, forgive; can’t some good translation give).
XV
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
They didn’t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashion’s duty,
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I can’t...
XVI
I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,
In life with us like new it’s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But let’s return to lady sitting.
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
Perhaps, you would agree, that is By marble charms unable Nina
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
XVII
‘Indeed? - my Eugene’s now thinking, - But is it true?..
Exactly...
Not...
Why! out of the country thickets...’
Lornette his captious he has got,
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
Forgotten features can remind.
‘You tell me, prince, if don’t mind,
Who’s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?’,
The prince as if anew him sees:
‘I see, in world you’ve been too rare...
Well, to present you I shall try’
‘But who is she?’ She is my wife,
XVIII
‘What, you are married! didn’t know!
And how long?’ ‘Two will he fast...’
‘And whom?’ - She’s Larin’s. -
‘Tanya though!’ ‘D’you know her?-
‘I’m neighbour just’.
‘Well, let us go…’ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
Presents his friend and distant kin.
Princess is staring at him...
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
XIX
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
And no brow moved she rasher; She didn’t even lips her press.
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
Could my Onegin now find.
To have a talk with her he tried
And… he could not.
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
If their district visits on?
And then at prince she was adjusting
Her tired look and slipped away...
Unmoving, lone he’s again.
XX
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
And where everything’s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
XXI
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
For evening party...
‘Lord! to her!..
Yes, I shall come, I’ll come!’ - before
His lunch him answered with politeness.
What happened, what a strange a dreamt
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?
XXII
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
It’s striking ten; he’s driving out. He’s flying... now he’s at porch.
He trembles... to princess he’s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
Together for a time they sit.
Are silent.
Not a word can slip
Away from Eugene’s lips; morose, He’s awkward, hardly has he force
To answer her.
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she’s free.
XXIII
Her husband comes.
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
And with Onegin’s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
They laugh; the guests are now coming.
And by the salt of worlds backbiting
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
And didn’t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
XXIV
The capital’s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
XXV
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
With Lea, that’s given him too sweety; With ladies’ flatness; tunes of men;
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;
With war; with magazine’s white lie; With snow and with own wife,
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What’s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you’d like, Or Eden to itself’s unlike.
XXVIII
But how greatly Tanya’s altered!
Her role how firmly played,
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
Of legislator of the halls?
And he inspired her at dawns!
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
XXIX
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
XXX
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
In languish of the loving bounds He’s spending now day and night.
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
He’s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
Or, like in fever, can he get A touch of hand, or helps to go
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
XXXI
To him she doesn’t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isn’t seeing;
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
To loose his colour he’s beginning: She doesn’t see or she’s too hard!?
Onegin’s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
XXXII
He doesn’t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
Before arrival; anyhow She isn’t bothered (that’s female!);
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
More brave than sound man, a grand His message wants to send: weak hand
A passionate epistle’s writing.
In letters though he again
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
Became alredy quite inapt.
His letter’s here, quite exact.
Eugene’s letter to Tatyana
I can foresee: you’ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
But what I’d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
I didn’t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
As I to loose my freedom feared Which’s hateful to my own will.
But something more us separated...
Unlucky victim, Lensky’s gone...
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
By nothing bound, I’m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
Replace the fortune.
Goodness me!
What blunder! I’m a punished ranger.
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
I’ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you I’m dangling:
I prize my hours, my days: But I’m in idle boredom wasting
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
I dread: in my submissive prayers You’ll see by strict, severe gaze
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
If you could know, what’s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
Meanwhile with cold sham to dare To force the speech and look with mock
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
I can’t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.
XXXIII
But no answer...
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
Without answer.
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
To meet princess.
But what severe!
He’s not been seen, none word from dear;
Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
Onegin’s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
Of tears tracks?..
But none she had!
Her face but has of wrath a track...
XXXIV
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (That’s all he knew in own world...)
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
XXXV
Again promiscuosly he’s reading… Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
XXXVI
And what?
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
At other kinds of lines.
To them He paid his all attention then.
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
XXXVII
And by degrees to sleep he’s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
In front of him gay fancy’s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he’s killed...’
Or can he see forgotten foes, Some cravens, slanderers, a swarm
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
Or village house - at the pane Is sitting she.., and she again!,.
XXXIII
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
Or could be poet with reasons (And I confess - could favour me).
Indeed, by magnetism’s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he’s a dunce.
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
Or Idol mio; dropped by chance On fire journals or his pumps.
XXXIX
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
He couldn’t be a bard for ever, He didn’t go mad or die,
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snow’s filthy
In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
But where now through them speeds
XL
My dashing Eugene?
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
None soul’s seen in rooms at entrance...
For her he’s looking on... for nought...
He opened a door."
And what.
Surprises deeply all his reeling?
Princess, undone yet before him
Alone’s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
XLI
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
She’s not astonished, hasn’t anger...
His morbid and quite dying look,
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
A simple maiden
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
XLII
To get him up she isn’t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
About what she’s now dreaming?
Too long the silence’s now seeming...
And stilly does she say at last:
‘Enough, get up, I now must
Explain to you, do it frankly.
You must remember that day time,
When in the garden’s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
XLIII
‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
Of humble girl some secret love?
But now - God! - is cooling blood
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...
But I
Can’t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
To me that time you were quite right,’ To you is grateful soul mine...
XLIV
‘But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
You didn’t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
And me you have in view...
What purpose?
Is it because in higher circles
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
In actions husband’s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
Or that’s because all my disgrace Would eyes attract to you, belated,
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
XLV
‘I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
To all these letters, tears, deeds...
That time to all my childish dreams
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
XLVI
‘To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
What’s use?
I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
XLVII
‘And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
But my fate
Decided is.
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
Some real honour and the pride.
I love you (why should I be cunning?).
They’ve made me marry other man; And I’ll be true to him till end!
XLVIII
She went away.
My Eugene’s standing As if by thunder has been struck,
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyana’s husband just appears,
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever.
Alter him
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
My greetings!
Hurra! we all have reached the land.
Indeed, for long should have the end!
XLIX
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, I’d like with you
To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
Forgive!
What for would ever view
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journal’s clamour
A mere hit from all I’d give.
Arid thus we now part, forgive!
L
My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
Of dear friends a pretty chat.
But many days away could get
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
LI
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
Without them Onegm’s pictured.
And she, that young and lovely creature;
Ideal image, Tanya’s rhyme...
Ah, many were by fate denied!
He’s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end life’s novel reading,
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
THE END
